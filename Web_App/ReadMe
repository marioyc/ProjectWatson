To run the demo:
1. Install Flask by pip. This is a package of python
2. cd to the root directory of Web_App/ , Then execute: python app.py
3. Open your web browser, go to localhost:5000

Note: It works well in Chrome but not well in Firefox, I don't know why for the moment. Anyway, use Chrome please.
