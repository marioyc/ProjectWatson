{"text": "\n           \n           I consider  trilogy the best fantasy, and perhaps the best fiction, ever written. Middle Earth is a beautiful, rich, complete land to which Narnia pales by comparison (don't get me wrong, I very much like Narnia, too).The beginning of the quest, which starts innocently but dives into a much larger, darker world than its protagonist, Frodo Baggins, could have ever imagined, is absolutely spellbinding. A small portion of the near-infinite background is revealed and armed with a shallow knowledge of the lore of the One Ring, Frodo embarks on a mission deeper and more dangerous and impactful than he could ever possibly have fathomed.The depth and beauty of Tolkien's work stems from his obsession with language and how world events impact its evolution. To create this book and its wealth, Tolkien developed 14 complete languages, all of which can be learned and spoken, written, and read. He created the lore and legend that each population clung to for their heritage. The relationships, distrusts, friendships, and animosities between the races stem from ancient and powerful roots. The detail of the world before the series lends it a believability that is virtually unparalleled even in many nonfiction works.I've read this series 4 or 5 times, which is something I have not done with any other work, aside from formative Christian religious texts. No one book is complete without the other two, so I consider them all to be the same book, divided into several parts--so as to allow for the faint of heart to enter Middle Earth in safer, smaller pieces.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Bryce", "stars": "5", "date": "Oct 12, 07", "likes": "46"},

{"text": "\n           \n           Tolkein's masterpiece is notable primarily for its historical significance. He basically invented the fantasy genre, and because of that all fantasy readers owe him a debt of gratitude. Many things in his books will seem somewhat cliche nowadays, but that's because they have been used so often since he wrote this book - almost all of them were original when this book was written.That said, Tolkein is not a terribly good writer. He tends to go on in excruciating detail about trivial concepts. Parts of the book, such as Ent poetry, are downright painful to read. And his leaf by leaf descriptions of forests can get fairly trivial. Since he wrote this series, several other fantasy writers have basically stolen the story and rewritten it with higher quality prose. Terry Brooks Shannara series, for example, is more or less identical in plot and characters, but Brooks is a notably better writer. So depending on whether you prefer the authentic text, or the better written text, you should choose accordingly. The notion of heroism in Tolkein is particularly worth noting. It is, so far as I can tell, the first set of novels that defines heroism entirely by internal features. The protagonist has no ability to fight, or to use magic, or basically do anything except to doing his best to do the right thing. This conception of heroism, which is what is what most people think of nowadays, is quite different than it was historically conceived (where heroism was synonymous with strength or ability, sometimes in conjunction with morality, but sometimes not). So, in this way, like so many others, Tolkein has had tremendous effect on popular culture.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Doc Opp", "stars": "3", "date": "Apr 29, 07", "likes": "90"},
{"text": "\n           \n           Read the review by Doc Opp; I think he covers it quite nicely. He explains how Tolkien was the forefather of fantasy writing, and why that makes his books important. He also shares his opinion that the historical importance sort of causes people to overlook that Tolkien couldn't write worth beans.Opp posits that perhaps it has something to do with the concept of heroism being different in Tolkien's days than it is now. I'm not sure I agree with that. I mean I agree that his characters are a study in perserverance without being able to really fight or do anything but perservere, I just don't know that I buy that it's a sign of the times. I think Tolkien was just boring.I don't disagree, also, that the Shannara series is essentially the same storyline with a better writer at the helm.My venom towards Tolkien is greater than Opp's perhaps because we read for different reasons. I have very little patience with writers who have great ideas or imaginations when it comes to the physical world, but can't get inside the head of a person to save their lives and thus can't tell a story. This sort of writer is often found in sci-fi/fantasy, because the genre is geared to reward the most innovative and plausible inventing of a future or past timescape.If guys like Opp were always doing the commentating I might not hate Tolkien with such a passion, but unfortunately the world is filled with people who don't read sci-fi but who recalled their lit teacher spoke Tolkien's name once and probably said something about how he was the father of modern fantasy, and those people went on to shout Tolkien's name from the rooftops to the extent that a movie even got made out of it. Now the movie I could actually stomach (a little) because Hollywood realized they couldn't completely bore the pants off of people and still make money. But I digress.I cannot conceive of any reason one would read these novels unless they were forced e.g. for a class. And even then, it'd better be a history class and not a writing class, unless the objective was to teach how not to write. There's no pace, no character development, the focus shifts between groups of characters ala Robert Jordan without any of Jordan's redeeming qualities (although Jordan certainly has faults as well).The most compelling reason to read these novels is so that you can rip someone a new one when they bring up Tolkien by making a point by point case where you describe all the things he does wrong.Let me put it this way, I have read some of the most God-awful books in my time. I mean when I was younger I would read a phone book if it was handy. But I could not finish the Fellowship of the Rings.Comparing Tolkien to Asimov is just...I mean that's like comparing me to Asimov. I have an imagination and so does Asimov, comparison ended. Asimov came up with a plausible future that was interesting, and then he wrote characters within that adventure that were compelling. Caves of Steel is brilliant because whatshisface the detective is sort of an everyman and Asimov deals with things such as embarrassment because your Dad's job doesn't rate you high enough to eat at the right hydroponics diner. I'm mangling things, but you get the point. Asimov may have been the best ever at having really cool ideas and not wasting them by forgetting to write about people.I hate Tolkien, I blame him for his vacuous and enraging fan base, I blame him for every author that followed him that spent 5 hours describing a blade of grass, I hate him for taking a genre that I like and making me want to vomit on it, even if he was the first. It makes me want to burn my entire fantasy bookshelf down to the ground.That's my review.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "adam", "stars": "1", "date": "May 03, 07", "likes": "59"},
{"text": "\n           \n            I suppose what I am about to type will be considered sacrilegious to some reading this review. However, I always believe in honesty in reviews, so here goes anyway :)As much as I love the story, I have to say that I liked the movie better than the book. *gasp* There\u2019s the blasphemy for you. Hehehehe. There was just so much singing in the book. I wish I could have skimmed the singing passages, but I was listening to the audiobook which made skipping the songs difficult. Maybe I was clouded in my judgement by the audiobook narrator\u2019s singing talent, but I grew very tired of it early on in the book. And yet, it continued\u2026 and continued\u2026 and continued.The LOTR movies that came out in the early part of the 21st century are some of my favorite movies. I was amazed by the cinematography, the story, the acting, and the music. The movies were something my husband and I could both enjoy together, and we have watched the movies numerous times over the last several years. Other than reading part of THE HOBBIT when I was a kid, I had never gotten around to reading the LOTR trilogy.After listening to my husband wax poetic about how much he loved to read the Lord of the Rings growing up, I made a decision that I wanted to read the books to see for myself how they compared to the movies. Now that I\u2019ve read the first book, I understand some of the characters my husband said were missing from the movies (such as Tom Bombadil). In regards to singing, Bombadil is definitely one of the main culprits! I kind of see why they chose to cut him out of the movie. I mean, the movie was already going to be really long anyway, so it seemed like a logical cut to me. I definitely love the world that Tolkien built. I didn\u2019t hate the book. I just found it to be a bit long-winded at times. SCANDAL! I know, I know. LOTR is a classic. I found myself saying things like: \u201cStop singing, Gimli and get on with the action!!!!\u201d. As much as I love the plot, I shouldn\u2019t be belittling the book\u2019s prose. But, I can\u2019t be the only one who feels that way. Well, maybe I am. I don\u2019t care. :PI still plan to continue the trilogy in book form. I have a feeling there will be less singing in the next book, but I could be fooled. I almost expect the guards of Mordor to break out into song. EEK! That\u2019s an image that might have me giggling in RETURN OF THE KING. Tap dancing/singing guards in a giant orc chorus-line. I need therapy\u2026 or more sleep.I suppose I now understand what compelled someone to make a musical version of LOTR. I had always wondered the motivation behind the musical in the UK, but they likely are trying to capture the spirit of the songs in the books.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "FlibBityFLooB", "stars": "3", "date": "Feb 16, 10", "likes": "26"},
{"text": "\n           \n           ( Want to read the complete review? Visit the article in !)I'll admit this: the only reason why I read the LOTR Trilogy was because I was jealous. The year: 1972. It was a time of ridiculously insane fashion: hot pants, maxi-coats (and pads) and rough-woven cotton shirts, so scratchy they felt like the sartorial equivalent of surgical gauze with chunks of wood stuck between the weave. It was not for the faint-hearted.And of course, who was the most faint-hearted? Me. I was entering a new high school in a new town in a country I hadn't live in since I was eight. And since I didn't fit in (or so I thought) I was desperate for a new identity. Since my sister had squatter's rights on the cute/adorable/PYT persona, I was left with the one that I later discovered would make high school life a living hell: The Smart One.The only problem was, I wasn't that smart. Sure, I could work in references to Betty Friedan with only the vaguest notion about who she was, but when you're surrounded with a peer group who thinks the face of feminism is Marlo Thomas, it was easy, except for the one person who was the true intellectual: Colleen. Colleen represented everything I wasn't: a polite, wise-beyond-her-years semi-adolescent with perfect skin and hair, who sported a near genius-level intellect. Think of an Asian Susan Dey with actual musical talent and the potential to enter Berkeley at fifteen. And it didn't help to have a mother whose daily mantra was \"why can't you be like Colleen?\"So I was in love/hate over Colleen. If Colleen wore culottes, I wore culottes, only mine were eight sizes larger. If Colleen cut her bangs, so did I. The problem was, she had straight Japanese hair that tumbled dutifully back into place whenever she tossed her sylph-like neck. Me? Picture the hair of a young, chubby and half-Japanese Phyllis Diller but without the wigline.But the one thing that stood out most about Colleen was her and her equally intellectually superior friends' obsession with LOTR. She told me stories of their endless discussions of Middle Earth, Gandolf and the rest of the lot. Images of Colleen and her friends, looking semi-elvish, slipping from class to class, dodging dull students, dogged me in English class. They were ninth-grade gods. It wasn't until Colleen told me they left an inside joke about their instructor on the blackboard in *Elvish* in one of their gifted classes that I decided to take action: I got on my bike, went to the local K-Mart and bought the Trilogy. I started out strong: the hobbits I was comfortable with. Then came the Elves. Then the dwarfs, the Orcs, the whatevers. After the parade of names like Bombadil, Elendil, Everclear, I had the horrible realization that I was hopelessly lost. And it wasn't going to be easy to find my way back.But I was undeterred. I sloughed my way through , then  and . I played little tricks to keep me interested: pretending I was one of the plucky hobbits, fantasizing myself as an Elven goddess--anything to keep me reading. It must have worked because I finished the damned set. But my plan didn't work. I was still me: I couldn't muster witticisms about Boromir to clueless classmates. I was still plump and my hair was as unruly as ever. Worse, my mother not only kept comparing me to Colleen, she started pulling out photos to illustrate her point. I shoved the books on the top shelf and tried not to think about being a Smart Kid ever again.But it was too late. I knew enough to be dangerous. I realized that even if I didn't like the books, I was familiar enough to make knowing comments about them to the right (i.e., AP-bound) clique. So I was accepted. Kinda.I still have the books. They're still sitting on my bookshelf, surviving countless moves and weedings.

{"text": "\n           \n           Authors who inspire a movement are usually misunderstood, especially by those they have inspired, and Tolkien is no exception, but one of the biggest misconceptions about Tolkien is the idea that he is somehow an 'innovator of fantasy'. He did add a number of techniques to the repertoire of epic fantasy writers, and these have been dutifully followed by his many imitators, but for the most part, these techniques are little more than bad habits.Many have called Tolkien by such epithets as 'The Father of Fantasy', but anyone who makes this claim simply does not know of the depth and history of the fantasy genre. For those who are familiar with the great and influential fantastical authors, from  and  to  and  to  and , it is clear that, long before Tolkien, fantasy was already a complex, well-established, and even a respected literary genre. contains an invented world, a carefully-constructed (and well-researched) archaic language, a powerful and unearthly queen, and a central character who is conflicted and lost between the forces of nobility and darkness. Poul Anderson's , which came out the same year as The Fellowship of the Ring, has distant, haughty elves, deep-delving dwarves, a broken sword which must be reforged, an epic war between the armies of light and darkness, another central character trapped between those extremes, and an interweaving of Christian and Pagan worldviews.So, if these aspects are not unique to Tolkien, then what does set him apart? Though Dunsany, Eddison, and Anderson all present worlds where light and dark come into conflict, they present these conflicts with a subtle and often ironic touch, recognizing that morality is a dangerous thing to present in absolutes. Tolkien (or ), on the other hand, has no problem in depicting evil as evil, good as good, and the only place they meet is in the temptation of an honest heart, as in Gollum's case--and even then, he is not like Eddison's Lord Gro or Anderson's Scafloc, characters who live under an alternative view of the world, but instead fluctuates between the highs and lows of Tolkien's dualistic morality.It is a dangerous message to make evil an external, irrational thing, to define it as 'the unknown that opposes us', because it invites the reader to overlay their own morality upon the world, which is precisely what most modern fantasy authors tend to do, following Tolkien's example. Whether it's  or John Norman's , its very easy to simply create a magical allegory to make one side 'right' and the other side 'wrong', and you never have to develop a dramatic narrative that actually explores the soundness of those ideas. Make the good guys dress in bright robes or silvery maile and the bad guys in black, spiky armor, and a lot of people will never notice that all the 'good guys' are White, upper class men, while all the 'bad guys' are 'brutish foreigners', and that both sides are killing each other and trying to rule their little corner of the world.In Tolkien's case, his moral view was a very specific evocation of the ideal of , which is an attempt by certain stodgy old Tories (like Tolkien) to rewrite history so that the nobility were all good and righteous leaders, the farmers were all happy in their 'proper place' (working a simple patch of dirt), while both industrialized cultures and the 'primitives' who resided to the South and East were 'the enemy' bent on despoiling the 'natural beauty of England' (despite the fact that the isles had been flattened, deforested, and partitioned a thousand years before).Though Tom Bombadil remains as a strangely incoherent reminder of the moral and social complexity of the fantasy tradition upon which Tolkien draws, he did his best to scrub the rest clean, spending years of his life  more wholly into his Pagan adventure realm. But then, that's often how we think of Tolkien: bent over his desk, spending long hours researching, note-taking, compiling, and playing with language. Even those who admit that Tolkien demonstrates certain racist, sexist, and classicist leanings (as, indeed, do many great authors) still praise the complexity of his 'world building'.And any student of the great Epics, like the Norse Eddas, the Bible, or the Shahnameh can see what Tolkien is trying to achieve with his worldbuilding: those books presented grand stories, but were also about depicting a vast world of philosophy, history, myth, geography, morality and culture. They were encyclopedic texts, intended to instruct their people on everything important in life, and they are extraordinarily valuable to students of anthropology and history, because even the smallest detail can reveal something about the world which the book describes.So, Tolkien fills his books with troop movements, dull songs, lines of lineage, and references to his own made-up history, mythology, and language. He has numerous briefly-mentioned side characters and events because organic texts like the epics, which were formed slowly, over time and compiled from many sources often contained such digressions. He creates characters who have similar names--which is normally a stupid thing to do, as an author, because it is so confusing--but he\u2019s trying to represent a hereditary tradition of prefixes and suffixes and shared names, which many great families of history had. So Tolkien certainly had a purpose in what he did, but was it a purpose that served the story he was trying to tell?Simply copying the form of reality is . Art is meaningful--it is directed. It is not just a list of details--everything within is carefully chosen by the author to make up a good story. The addition of detail is not the same as adding depth, especially since Tolkien\u2019s world is not based on some outside system--it is whatever he says it is. It\u2019s all arbitrary, which is why the only thing that grants a character, scene, or detail purpose is the meaning behind it. Without that meaning, then what Tolkien is doing is just a very elaborate thought exercise. Now, it\u2019s certainly true that many people have been  with studying it, but that\u2019s equally true of many thought exercises, such as the rules and background of the Pokemon card game, or crossword puzzles.Ostensibly, Scrabble supposedly is a game for people who love words--and yet, top Scrabble players sit an memorize lists of words whose meaning they will never learn. Likewise, many literary fandom games become little more than word searches: find this reference, connect that name to this character--but which have no meaning or purpose outside of that. The point of literary criticism is always to lead us back to human thought and ideas, to looking at how we think and express ourselves. If a detail in a work cannot lead us back to ourselves, then it is no more than an arbitrary piece of chaff.The popularity of Tolkien\u2019s work made it acceptable for other authors to do the same thing, to the point that whenever I hear a book lauded for the \u2018depth of its world building\u2019, I expect to find a mess of obsessive detailing, of piling on so many inconsequential facts and figures that the characters and stories get buried under the scree, as if the author secretly hopes that by spending most of the chapter describing the hero\u2019s cuirass, we'll forget that he\u2019s a bland archetype who only succeeds through happy coincidence and  against an enemy with no internal structure or motivation.When Quiller-Couch said authors should \u2018murder their darlings\u2019, this is what he meant: just because you have hobbies and opinions does not mean you should fill your novel with them. Anything which does not materially contribute to the story, characters, and artistry of a work can safely be left out. Tolkien's embarrassment of detail also produced a huge inflation in the acceptable length of fantasy books, leading to the meandering, unending series that fill bookstore shelves today.Now, there are several notable critics who have lamented the unfortunate effect that Tolkien\u2019s work has had on the genre, such as in Moorcock\u2019s  and Mieville\u2019s  about every modern fantasy author being forced to come to terms with the old don's influence. I agree with their deconstructions, but for me, Tolkien isn\u2019t some special author, some \u2018fantasy granddad\u2019 looming over all. He\u2019s just a bump in the road, one author amongst many in a genre that stretches back thousands of years into our very ideas of myth and identity, and not one of the more interesting onesHis ideas weren\u2019t unique, and while his approach may have been unusual, it was only because he spent a lifetime trying obsessively to make something artificial seem more natural, despite the fact that the point of fantasy (and fiction in general) is to explore the artificial, the human side of the equation, to look at the world through the biased lens of our eye and to represent some odd facet of the human condition. Unfortunately, Tolkien\u2019s characters, structure, and morality are all too flat to suggest much, no matter how many faux-organic details he surrounds them with.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "J.G.

{"text": "\n           \n           What can I say about ? I could go on and on forever. It is my #1 favorite book of fiction of all that I've ever read in my entire life. I am going to review each book separately, but much of what I have to say here applies to all 3 of the books. LOTR is so incredibly EPIC! The scope of the story expands as it progresses to enormous proportions. Tolkien uses a very sophisticated \"old\" style of writing which at first I found intimidating but eventually I got used to and which now I find very beautiful and poetic. His descriptions of the people, places, cultures, languages, history, and events of Middle Earth are just so incredibly rich and detailed, it is fascinating to me to learn about them as I read. I find the characters to be very interesting, to the point where I have grown to deeply love them and sympathize with them. LOTR addresses all sorts of universal themes and concepts that teach us his view of the human condition. It explores friendship, loyalty, bravery, greed, faith, and many more. Indeed, I consider LOTR to be the closest thing I've ever read to my concept of the \"ultimate\" or \"ideal story\". I have read LOTR multiple times and I imagine I'll read it many more times. I first read it in college for an English class. I had wanted to read it for years prior to that but I was intimidated by it so I didn't until college.I admit LOTR has its flaws. There are spots where the story drags, such as the many pages where he describes the characters marching endless miles through forests or swamps or mountains without much happening. Sometimes I wonder, \"why is he talking about this? Why doesn't he just jump ahead to the good stuff?\". One can argue that he introduces too many characters and that some of them are not developed enough. Some would say some of the characters are too 2-dimentional, and that everything is too black and white from a moral standpoint. I admit those shortcomings, but in the end none of them matter much to me. In spite of all those imperfections, the book is still a work of genius that is unmatched by anything else I've ever read. The story is so big and powerful it just blows me away and leaves me in awe.Fellowship is perhaps my second-favorite of the 3 books, after Return of the King. I absolutely love the first few chapters. You learn so much about the history of the Ring and of Middle-Earth. The Ring is shrouded in mystery at first and as the mysteries are revealed, the terrible state things are in is realized. A really cool ominous feeling of foreboding sets in that grabs you and pulls you in so that you have to keep reading. The meeting with Strider in Bree, the encounter with the Ringwraiths at Weathertop, the Council of Elrond, and the encounter with the Balrog in Moria are some of the most dramatic, exciting events of the whole series. The only complaints I have with Fellowship is that it suffers the most of all 3 books from what I described earlier: there are definitely a few slow parts where the pace of the story really drags. Fellowship is one of the ultimate Road Trip Stories, much like Star Wars: a New Hope, or Wizard of Oz. One or two characters start out on a journey, and they meet people along the way who join them. Along the way they become close devoted friends as they go through adventures together. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Fred D", "stars": "5", "date": "Dec 20, 07", "likes": "14"},

{"text": "\n           \n           Sorry, J.R.R.: I am going to review the three volumes separately, but it\u2019s really more of a running commentary of what\u2019s on my mind. I don\u2019t actually see The Lord of the Rings as three separate books; the volumes just provide a good place to pause and take stock. And there\u2019s always a lot to take stock of, when you\u2019re reading these books: Tolkien made sure of that. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve read them for pleasure since my Tolkien module during my MA, but that aspect of my reading is maybe a bit further behind me right now. Still, I can\u2019t not appreciate the extra richness that reading gave me, the breadth of Middle-earth. There\u2019s so much I want to know more about \u2014 the Barrow Downs, the world Tom Bombadil first walked in\u2026 and not as glimpses, but the way we see them through the eyes of the hobbits or other members of the Company.One thing that\u2019s easy to forget is the sheer scale of the landscape they cross. People complain that it takes whole pages to get anywhere, but rarely the opposite: that the whole journey between Rivendell and Hollin is done in a page, that Hollin is just a stop on the way to Caradhras and Moria, when again, there\u2019s so much more we could know about Hollin. Two things contributed to me thinking about that this time: one, I play LOTRO. Now thankfully, Lath has a war steed now, so I can cover a lot of ground, but the first fetch quests in the Shire drove me nuts. So much running! And even that is necessarily scaled down, else you\u2019d have to sit back and take literally a day to run across the Shire. Not ideal for an MMORPG. Secondly, I\u2019m part of a Walk to Mordor challenge, and wow. The miles it takes us to get anywhere \u2014 we\u2019re barely progressing faster than the Company did, despite the fact that we\u2019re adding everyone\u2019s miles together.One thing I do feel is the lack of a real Welsh influence here. This is \u201ca mythology for England\u201d (or is it \u201cof England\u201d? I\u2019ve forgotten the exact quote now), not Britain, and all the focus is on the Anglo-Saxon kind of world. You can tell me about the Welsh influences until you\u2019re blue in the face, but what gets me about Tolkien\u2019s world is that absence. The troubled Welsh background is pushed aside \u2014 perhaps there in the Dunlendings\u2019 struggle with the Rohirrim, but it\u2019s not like that is a major theme, or that they\u2019re treated with much sympathy.Which is fair enough, but it does make me sad that Tolkien didn\u2019t fold those issues into his mythology. I would\u2019ve liked to see more of those tensions, that complex history, echoing through Middle-earth as it still does through modern Britain.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Nikki", "stars": "5", "date": "Dec 17, 14", "likes": "16"},

{"text": "\n           \n           Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien was so much more enchanting then I remember. It just goes to show how much our tastes can change along with how we view the world can alter as we get older. I really didn't like any of these books when I was a kid, but it was fantastic. I couldn't wait to finish it so I could watch the movie again, which I hadn't seen in years. I was impressed by how closely the movie followed this book, beside the leaving out of Tom Bombadil. The elves and Galadriel are still my favorite characters, there's just something about the way they hold themselves and how they perceive the world that's captivating. Not to mention their awesome magical abilities. I'm so glad I decided to read these again. Not only am I viewing them in an entirely different light, but I never knew/remembered how much poetry/prose/lyrics/whatever you want to call it is in this book! I'm so saddened when I hear that people skip over that stuff just so they can get to the \"good\" parts, never realizing much of it is, in fact, the \"good stuff\". It tells the history of the land, it helps us understand the characters and their motives better, and it's just really beautiful. It really adds to the story for me. I absolutely love it. The book wouldn't be half as good without it. Reading these books again also allows me to better understand fantasy book reviews, since a good 90% of them are compared to Lord of the Rings. Tokien has yet to fail at bringing me under his spell. With every battle, with every song, and with every scenery description, his loquaciousness pulls me in. I also challenge anyone to find a reason this can't be a classic. Besides the massive following, it is without a doubt, the cornerstone of its genre. Like I mentioned earlier, very few fantasy novels aren't compared to this trilogy at one time or another. It has the magic factor, longevity, and underlying themes. It has an original concept - the first story like this of it's kind. And it's had substantial influence in its genre for decades.

{"text": "\n           \n           When we're talking about novels that for some reason happen to be overshadowed by their big-screen movie adaptations (granted, not many exist), then  belongs into that category. I know that the -purists might crucify me for saying this, but I'm saying it nonetheless. For me, watching these movies usually equals an exercise of little to medium effort; reading the book, I often found myself on the verge of frustration. And I'm not one with an attention span of a grapefruit. My problem is this - the text is too heavily loaded with superfluous exposition and details. I kept losing track of the new names and places that popped up on every fifth page or so. Alright, I get that we're dealing with a genius who's created a fictional universe intricate enough (and I bow down - the languages sound exquisite) to require its own encyclopedia, but for heaven's sake... crafting a story shouldn't be about how much background and side info can be shoved into it. Just because you have it, doesn't mean you have to flaunt it. Sometimes less is more approach works better. Offers the reader a bit of breathing room.The writing style is too dry. If we take the Harry Potter series for comparison (I'm aware that it's a crime to do that, but I'm doing it anyway), the fantasy world in there is lush and bubbling. And don't tell me that's because the Harry Potter books are children's books and The Lord Of The Rings isn't. It has Hobbits and Elves in it. And chattering trees.The characters in The Lord Of The Rings have always confused me somewhat. Nearly all of the primary archetypes are represented, but they don't seem to have that larger-than-life aura that many other characters have in other epic sagas. It is almost as if the weight of the Middle Earth suffocates them. They leave a lasting impression, yet don't seem to be very relatable. Boromir, the humanized knight, dies before I can really start to care about what he was going through. Aragorn's heroics remain too distant, and I can't quite identify with Frodo or Sam either, wonderful as they certainly are.I realize that my thoughts manifest themselves in more of a rant than an actual review, but if I could sum up how I feel about  (at least the written version) - then this would be it. I struggle to reach a level on which I am able to thoroughly and comfortably enjoy this grand old battle between good and evil.Maybe it is my fault and I should try harder.

{"text": "\n           \n           28 October 2011\tThe difficulties with trilogies is that while they are three books the same plot and theme tends to run through all three of them. It really does depend on the story though as there are a number which are self contained, but due to the popularity, the author writes a second, third (and sometimes more). However, this is not the case with Lord of the Rings. Tolkein originally intended that the story be in one book, however for economic reasons it was decided that it would be released as a trilogy.\tThe plot (which you probably already know anyway) pretty much runs through all three books. The hero, a Hobbit named Frodo Baggins, inherits a ring which turns out to be a powerful artifact that the dark lord Sauron wants back. However, very bad things will happen if it falls into the hands of Sauron and it is decided that the ring must be destroyed, but the only way to do it is to throw it into the 'Cracks of Doom', a volcano where the ring was originally forged (that also happens to lie in the middle of Sauron's domain).\tNow, I will spend some time talking about the nature of the ring, and also look at the history of Middle Earth as it comes up to the Lord of the Rings. Lord of the Rings is unique in that the main antagonist is not so much Sauron, but the ring. The ring represents power, and whoever possesses the ring wields great power. However the ring has a very corrupting influence over all of its owners, and one cannot possess the ring without becoming mad, or even coming under the influence of Sauron. This is what makes the ring such an awesome antagonist in that it cannot be used for good, no matter how noble the intentions of the owner are. It will always corrupt you.\tFrodo is not immune to this, and we can see this at the end of the story when, despite all of the hardships that he endures to reach his goal, he simply cannot let go of the ring. It is only by accident that the ring falls into the Cracks of Doom and is destroyed. Secondly the ring is a burden, and we are constantly reminded on how it weighs down Frodo's soul. He does not want the burden, but he knows that it has fallen to him to carry it, but even then, despite him being pure of heart, the ring will and does corrupt him. This is such that despite completing his quest, he simply cannot return to his normal life in the Shire and must leave with his uncle Bilbo Baggins to travel over the seas with the elves.\tWhen Tolkien originally drafted the books he did not do so in isolation. Many fantasy novels (and films) are simply created out of a vacuum. Nothing really existed before and nothing exists after. All we see is what occurs in the action of the story. Granted there might be a rough history that leads up to the events of the story, but nothing all that deep. This is not the case with the Lord of the Rings. When Tolkein drafted his story he did it against a very deep and rich background. His Middle Earth is not a trilogy about a hobbit and a ring, but a living and vibrant world with a deep and colourful history.\tGranted, not everything in the history of Middle Earth is important to the plot, but it adds character and colour to the story. The actual story begins at the end of the second age when the king of men, Isildur, goes to war against the forces of Sauron, and while Sauron is defeated, Isildur does not have the last laugh. He removes the ring from Sauron's hand and is immediately corrupted by it, and then finds himself killed in an ambush at Gladden Feilds. That was 3000 years before the current events, and there is a lot that happens before and between them as well. This history is outlined in the appendix to Return of the King for those who are interested, and there are numerous other books containing tales from the history of Middle Earth (the best being the ).\tHowever, I will finish off with Sauron. Sauron is the bad guy, but in the grand scheme of Middle Earth he is not  bad guy. That title falls to his boss, Morgoth. Now, Morgoth vanishes at the end of the First Age when Belariand is destroyed and the world remade. However, Sauron is his leiutenant, and when Morgoth steps out of the picture, Sauron enters. He is a subtle and manipulative individual, and while we do not meet him in The Lord of the Rings (he always floats in the background, and we know that he is present and that he is powerful, but he operates through his minions such as Sauruman and the Nazgul) he does make appearances in the earlier story. What comes to mind is the tale of Numenor, which is Tolkien's version of Atlantis (more on that later). Numenor was a mighty and powerful human empire, but they were corrupted, and this came about because they allowed Sauron to become their king. It is not that Sauron is openly explicity but that he goads others to commit evil acts, and he does this with the Numenorians when he goads them into sailing west to take on the Valar (sort of very powerful angelic beings). It is not Sauron that is punished though, it is the Numenorians as their empire is destroyed and they are scattered to the four winds.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "David Sarkies", "stars": "5", "date": "Oct 12, 15", "likes": "10"},

He\u2019s a bit of a hardass, but it\u2019s all an act.And we can\u2019t forget the love interests, can we? We\u2019ve got the confused, mysterious Allison played here by the lovable Sam. And the heroine of our tale, the gal all the boys are going to lose their heads over, the Ben Harrison of this group: Aragorn (Claire). There are some other characters (Sauron/Principal Vernon immediately comes to mind), but, for the point of this analogy, they\u2019re irrelevant.We\u2019ve got this group, which, really, consists of two couples (no one gives a shit about Brian/Pippin). We watch them as they grow to love one another over the course of this long Saturday. Our hearts get invested pretty quickly and we are ensnared in their relationship. Are Frodo and Allison going to hold hands as they walk? Are Bender and Aragorn going to sneak off to the bushes?It holds you, doesn\u2019t it?*SPOILER*But here\u2019s the proverbial shit on the shoe: this particular adaptation includes the sequel. The group gets cleaved. Boromir gets fucked (and not by Aragorn), leaving his beloved to wander through the wild after the geek. Sam and Frodo head down a likely doomed path toward a crack of doom in an effort to destroy the ring, a symbol of their relationship. Nothing lasts forever. Not middle earth. Not a chance happening between two hobbits. Boromir\u2019s arrow riddled body is a testament to that fact.So what are we left with? Where do we go from here?Dunno. The sequel has a sequel. Will Andrew and Sam survive the crack of doom? Will Sauron catch them in the hall without a pass?*/SPOILER*TO BE CONTINUED\u2026\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Caris", "stars": "3", "date": "Jun 11, 10", "likes": "11"},

{"text": "\n           \n           What's needed to be said about the book that changed fantasy as we know it? If Robert Howard was the creator of Sword and Sorcery and others before him trended on Fantasy, Tolkien took it to the main publishers and began the Golden Age of Fantasy. Almost every writer in fantasy fiction read Tolkien. Almost every writer knows that he is the main Father and revered him. Review Part IIThe first review I made more than 10 years ago. There wasn't any LotR on the horizon so it was a long time ago. It was my second step in to fantasy (the first was dragonlance) and I remember that I enjoyed the book but found it boring at times.My perspective of the book reading now after 500 books under my belt, has not changed. The book is a masterpiece. No doubt about it. This book can be thought on schools to help young boys/girls read, because it's a masterpiece. That's how I put it. It has quality to teachers teach young people and at the same time it could be fun.After reading the book I watch the movie and there are differences no doubt about it. But, overall the movie does not stray far from the novel and giving at the same time some action that this book doesn't not have, at all. This book is boring it terms of action. I am sorry but it is. At times I needed some action, some swordfight, some sense of danger and in my opinion this book lack any danger whatsoever. The characters are always safe. In the end when they are getting down the river and the orcs fire some arrows they talked like something trivial was happening. So, in my opinion, its this:- Read the novel and watch the film. They are marvelous and one will help the other. One will fill you up with the blanks, the descriptions, the scenery, the talking, the songs and the other will have you on the edge with all the battles. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Paulo \"paper books always\" Carvalho", "stars": "5", "date": "Nov 28, 14", "likes": "9"},

{"text": "\n           \n           As we all know, the  movies, directed by the incomparable Peter Jackson, are easily among the greatest artistic triumphs of the 21st century. Such magnificent accomplishments often attract imitators; fan fiction abounds, tributes crop up left and right, and parodies are inescapable. But perhaps the most notable piece of artwork to come from the post-LOTR crave is the book series by one J.R.R. Tolkien.When I first heard of it, I was interested. A book adaptation of a movie? Neat! But how could any author, however skilled, hope to capture the almost divine magic of the films? Tolkien had set himself quite a task. A book version of, say,  or  might be more doable. But Tolkien got an enthusiastic response; I heard good things about his books. And when I saw that Manny gave it five stars, I couldn\u2019t resist any longer.So is the adaptation successful? Well, let\u2019s go through it part by part. Although Tolkien can\u2019t hope to top Jackson\u2019s mind-blowing cinematographic , Tolkien\u2019s prose is doughty. He ably handles descriptions of Middle Earth, indulging in little historical asides here and there (more on that later), and more or less evoking the Middle Earth we all know and love so well from Jackson\u2019s films.Tolkien\u2019s characters are also fairly successful. He manages to evoke the personalities of Frodo, Gandalf, and Aragorn; some of the other characters are botched (Legolas is much too dainty compared to Orlando Bloom\u2019s original), but, on the whole, I think we can give him a passing grade. Of course, he can\u2019t quite capture the beautiful cadences of Ian McKellen\u2019s speech, or the warmth and charm of Sean Astin\u2019s role. But Tolkien is only human, after all; and we can\u2019t fault him for not living up to some of the greatest acting of all time.Tolkien is also endearingly dorky. He allows himself to get absorbed in the rich mythological and historical world that Peter Jackson created. Tolkien even makes up a few stories himself, filling in the little nooks and crannies left in Jackson\u2019s great edifice. A lot of these historical asides come in the form of songs and poems. Personally, I could have done without many of them; but Tolkien is a fine crafter of rhymes, so the poetry is at least not painful.There are a few curious departures from the original plot. For example, Tolkien takes some material from the third movie and puts it into the first. Specifically, instead of Treebeard saving Merry and Pippin from attacking trees, a creature named Tom Bombadil does. I wonder what the motivation was for this change; for how will the ents destroy Isengard (one of the most iconic scenes in those iconic movies) if Tolkien phases out their role in the plot?It\u2019s hard to forgive Tolkien for tampering with the work of a master. But his good-natured enthusiasm for the movies that have defined the present generation of movie-goers amply compensates for whatever shortcomings his adaptation may have when compared with the originals.P.S. I've heard Tolkien has a  adaptation in the works, too!\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Lotz", "stars": "4", "date": "Feb 27, 15", "likes": "8"},
{"text": "\n           \n           It took me three tries to read  the first time through. I tried once after finishing  my freshman year of high school, and I tried again a couple of months later. I kept getting stuck at Tom Bombadil, and the immense amount of detail thrown into the text overwhelmed me. I tried again a third time when  called out to me from a shelf on the library. The movie was coming out, , and it was time to finally conquer the thing. (Sidenote: Watching that trailer again for the first time in years put goosebumps over my entire body, and I remembered exactly where I was and who I was with the first time I saw it.) I finally made it past Bombadil, and once I was in Bree and there was Strider, I was done for. That was it. I was in love for life. The strangest thing about these books is that the first time you read them, it's very difficult. There's names and histories and songs and Tolkien just throws them out there with no explanation. You get the impression that there's this vast world you'll never be able to grasp. But upon re-read, everything is clearer, and the more I re-read them, the more I understand his world. It's like how when you've never been to a place before and it seems to take forever to get there, and everything is unfamiliar, but then every time you return to that place, time moves faster, you recognize your surroundings. That's what it's like to read Tolkien. It feels real and physical, like the geography of Middle Earth is just there, waiting for you. There's a real sense of history to Tolkien's famously intricate and old-fashioned prose that gives the trilogy a sense of maturity that is missing from almost all fantasy published since. Tolkien's Middle Earth is a real place, where joy is touched by constant sadness, and nothing lasts forever.  is as much elegy as it is celebration. The book itself mourns for the passing of an age, but we as its readers are simply sad that it never actually existed in the first place. But perhaps Peter S.

It was just great, the world (Middle earth), the characters (especially the hobbits) and the story itself. I have been a fan of the movie since I was in High School and I didn't even watch the Fellowship of the Rings first because I started with The Two Towers movie and then Return of the King and then The Fellowship (I sometimes watch movies this way). And even if a lot of my friends back then are hardcore Harry Potter movie fans (and I am also a hardcore HP fan) I always answer when ask what my favorite movie is, it's always Lord of the Rings (still it's my favorite movie I think). So, my love for Lord of the Rings was already there when I started reading this one. I didn't have the chance to read it before because the copy in our school library was really thick and heavy. I also can't find an e-book copy online but thanks to one of my friend here in goodreads I've got the chance to finally read it. I must say if you're really into fantasy you've got to read this. This has been the greatest fantasy book ever written and it has inspired J. K. Rowling, George Martin and a lot of authors and it is also the inspiration to a lot of computer games like Warcraft. So yeah read it if you have the time.The book was a little bit boring at first but once the characters were on Rivendell the pace will pick up.

And a lot of the other parts that are missed out in the movie you can read in the book. My only complaint about the book is that it has a lot of song lyrics like I think for every chapter the hobbits or the elves will sing and it was just blah and then I skimmed reading those parts :).

And now I can review it.There are many praiseful things I can say about this book, but I'll try to keep it short. One of the sharpest things about this first installment of  trilogy is its ability to create terror and suspense without actually introducing us to the enemy, Sauron (or even Saruman, his wizard henchman, for more than a few pages at least). The evil that the fellowship fights is instead manifested through the feelings and experiences of our nine companions, and is perhaps more frightening than any graphic movie or novel. Tolkien takes this story beyond a simple good vs. evil tale most explicitly in this first book - we see evil that is older and markedly different than that of Sauron (barrow wights, for instance) and meet characters that don't fall sway to the power of the Ring (Tom Bombadil). We're given the perspective that, while this battle for Middle Earth is fundamentally important, that no matter what, the world will go on.And while we are introduced to a world so totally different from our own, we feel the parallels and lessons offered by Tolkien acutely. His ability to balance familiarity and epic so effortlessly will always blow me away.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Julie", "stars": "5", "date": "May 02, 08", "likes": "6"},

And then I had the wild idea, curled up in bed with The Fellowship of the Ring and the remnants of my flu, to try reading the whole book (i.e. what is erroneously called the trilogy) in twenty-four hours.Spoiler: I managed it, even with an awful lot of unintentional sleeping.I don't know that I got any revelations out of doing this, except that I really do enjoy Tolkien's writing. It is true, though, that every time I read Tolkien I get something new/different/extra out of it. I enjoyed every scrap of this, forcing myself to be patient even with the bits that seem like Tolkien was indulging himself -- I know people often skip the Tom Bombadil part, for example, but it really is important to the world and mythology he's building.In the case of The Fellowship of the Ring, I found it the slowest of the three volumes, this time, and actually I do believe it's the longest. Still, it's wonderful to watch the way Tolkien shifts tone: The Hobbit and this work smoothly together if put side-by-side in chronological order, but can you imagine the narration and voice of The Hobbit coming  Lord of the Rings? What a hideous mismatch that'd be.

I know a lot of people hate various episodes in the book -- most often Tom Bombadil -- but I can't help but love it.

{"text": "\n           \n           I had a conversation last night in which someone suggested to me that the beginning section of Fellowship of the Ring is something of a \"hard sell\" when trying to convince people to indulge Tolkien and the rest of us geeks by reading this mythic masterpiece, rather than y'know, watching that slightly famous film version. In many ways I'd like to place a curse on that film version because it gives the false impression that Lord of the Rings is pure Hollywood blockbuster rather than the rewriting of myth and legend that Tolkien had in mind - certainly what one loses by watching the film is the ephemera, the poetry and the allusions to a rich history that is, if not always the most engaging, certainly one of the more complex and impressive facets of this tale. I've certainly spoken to people who love the movies, love fantasy novels but hate the actual work because it comes across as tedious, dull and boring.Is it really possible to view this book as tedious and dull? Or a hard sell? Has the world moved on since I was 11 years old because I recall long afternoons worrying with Frodo as he got lost in the old forest, attacked by Barrow Wights and finally made his long hard won journey to Bree, meeting the mysterious Strider before unceremoniously nearly getting bumped off by the mysterious black horseman who have relentlessly and terrifyingly pursued him all the way. Is this what passes for dull now, because for me there was and still is something gripping about being able to spend time with these confused and frightened hobbits, taken from their simple life of luxury and being thrown into a bigger confusing world, and just somehow dealing with it, even though they don't really know how. There's so much that's magical and entertaining about the Shire and the lands around it, and whilst characters like Tom Bombadil beguile and confuse, they never ever threaten to bore. Reading the first section of the book I confess to feeling like Sam, I want to get out that door and see some elves and damn how bloody dangerous this quest is because it's something different.In short, the opening to The Lord of the Rings is one of the loveliest to any adventure story and to deny it its admittedly subtle pleasures is to deny yourself the pleasure of the true journey. I don't believe that one can appreciate what follows without admiring this portion of the book; one cannot care for Aragorn, Boromir, Lothlorien or Minas Tirith without understanding the bravery and the good nature of the people they are protecting and the beauty and strangeness of the lands in which they live. Tolkien continually emphasizes that Boromir and the people of Gondor have so often got caught up in the fight against Mordor, so arrogant have the human people become that they neglect their history and their lore, and they fail to appreciate just what it is they are defending. Viewers of the movie or those desperate to push onwards to bigger battles strike me as being the same.The second half of the book naturally extends the theme of companionship set up in the first. The fellowship never really seem to get a chance to find their feet as a group and, muddling through bigger dangers they lose their guide and mentor before breaking down entirely as Boromir, brave and ultimately loyal though he is, fails to appreciate the true nature of the quest at hand. It's a ramshackle group, really, but friendships are formed and racial tensions dissolved along the way and perhaps that's what's important about this stage of the journey and it's appropriate that the book ends with Frodo's realisation that it just isn't going to work - and Sam's realisation that Frodo is going to need a companion, regardless. On previous reads I've always focussed on the big, epic nature of the saga and the journey, but this time through it struck me that the book is full of a surprising amount of intimacy; the long section devoted to Lothlorien is not without its longeurs, but it goes to show that the quiet time, the forming of bonds and friendships, the giving of gifts, is as important to Tolkien as a massive fight with an ancient Balrog.I'm not sure if I should be rating and reviewing The Lord of the Rings as a single book, or as individual volumes. It probably doesn't matter. However, taken on its own merits, although I've read this many times before, it remains to me a masterpiece of storytelling both thematically and evocatively. It's all but impossible for me not to get caught up in Tolkien's world or the drama of the ring and time spent with this volume is not time that could be spent in any better way. What surprised me this time around was the characterisation, which seemed subtler, more coherent and memorable than it ever has done before. No, you won't find long pages of monologue or dialogue discussing character motivation, since Tolkien is not a modern writer, he's a writer with his eye firmly on the Medieval literature he so adored and his methods of delineating character are perhaps quieter but no less effective.It all seems like a fairly easy sell to me.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Alex ", "stars": "5", "date": "Sep 03, 14", "likes": "6"},

{"text": "\n           \n           When the first of the Lord of the Rings movie came out a little over ten (!!!) years ago, I admit that I only watched it for two reasons: (1) everyone in my senior high school class was watching it; and (2) all the girls in my class who has watched the movie were all raving about Legolas. I didn't care about the book (I can't even remember if I knew of the book back then), but I only watched it because I didn't want to be left out. I was sufficiently amazed by the movie (even if my dad slept halfway through it -- it was our \"date\"), and I was charmed by Legolas, but I didn't become one of the people who would watch it over and over and over again. In fact, when I tried watching it again while I was alone, I fell asleep! When I learned of the book, I knew that I wouldn't read it anytime soon because I wasn't a fantasy reader and I honestly thought watching the movie was enough.My stance on not reading the trilogy remained the same even as I was exploring fantasy and as I started blogging about books. I've heard so many things about it -- how it's so hard to read, how it can be boring and how it's not for everyone, so the part of me that gets intimidated by high fantasy decided to leave it alone. Until of course, it became our book of the month for my book club's discussion. Being a co-moderator of the book club, I felt like I had no choice but to read it.I don't think I need to recap what happened in this book for anyone because I feel that everyone knows about it already.  So here's my big surprise with : it wasn't such a hard read after all. Maybe if I attempted to read this back in high school or even in college, I wouldn't have liked it as much. But now...I actually found it quite easy to get into. Oh, the prologue is kind of boring, but after that? It was really kind of easy. I suppose I had the proper conditioning too, because I read  the previous month (which is pretty high fantasy too) followed by  a few weeks later, which I read almost simultaneously with this book. I suppose this put me in the proper fantasy mindset, which perhaps helped it become easier for me to read. Sure, the hobbits and elves sang so many times in the book, and sure, Tolkien described the scenery in so much detail that it can be a bit boring at times...but overall? I thought  deserved all the praises that it has gotten ever since.I guess it helped that I already had the visualization of the movie while I read the book, so sometimes I can't help but smile whenever I remember Orlando Bloom as Legolas or Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn. I loved the Council of Elrond scene even if it was the longest chapter of the book, and I was excited to get to the Balrog scene with Gandalf shouting,  (the movie version seemed more kick-ass, though!). But overall, I realized how much I liked Frodo and Sam's friendship was written in this book. I never really cared for Sam in the movie (especially after it has been tainted so much because of their seemingly bromantic relationship), but in this book, I thought he was such a darling. Sam's loyalty was the highlight of this book, and I loved how he was so devoted to his friend in his simple minded ways. It totally changed everything for me when I rewatched the movie.As with , I felt a certain kind of accomplishment when I finished reading this book. LOL, I felt like I was such a cooler geek when I was done with this, but apparently, I think I need to read the other LOTR books before I can be certified. :P Which I really intend to do, especially because I really liked  and the ending of  was kind of a cliffhanger.To sum it up: . I get what makes this series so amazing -- or at least, a part of it, anyway. :) It helps that this appreciation was fueled by our book club's discussion afterwards. Look at us here: is definitely one of those books that one should read in their lifetime.

Read this as myth in a book.LOTR comes with an incredible sense of history in an incredible world, lovingly detailed. It is basically mythology - and even has a creation myth (Silmarillion). If you focus too much on the plot or the characters you lose that. Forget about your usual contemporary sci-fi/fantasy fare. Forget about suspense and mystery and excitement and just concentrate on the pure beauty of the world and the writing. You will find that whatever your opinions on the 2 elements of character & plot are, they do not detract from the deep poignancy that permeates the trilogy.I love the wonderful textures of LOTR and the sensitivity to language. There is nothing pretentious about LOTR, and I certainly don't read it because of Tolkien's historical significance (in fact, I learnt about all that after I read LOTR and decided to find out more about the author). LOTR is heroically beautiful and heart-breakingly majestic. To me, reading it feels a lot like listening to classical music and this might sound strange, but this lengthy epic is actually one of the saddest books I've ever read.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Lifeworld", "stars": "5", "date": "Oct 22, 07", "likes": "5"},

{"text": "\n           \n           How do I put this lightly? Lord of the Rings is renowned by readers and fantasy lovers all of the world, right up there with amazing books like Harry Potter. The whole time I was reading I kept telling myself that I was reading what many people call a masterpiece. I should read this with an open mind, look for the good stuff. I did that for about 200 pages before I gave up. I'm well aware that this book has gone on to inspire hundreds of writers. Some of my favorite books probably wouldn't exist without it. I've heard it said that this book has shaped the entire fantasy genre, and I don't doubt it.Problem is, those fantasy books inspired by this one ended up being better. We have to face it, Tolkien's writing style just isn't for everyone. I can tell he really enjoyed world building, but is there such a thing as overworldbuilding? I just felt that Tolkien went overboard, describing every little thing. It ended up feeling like a massive infodump.There were perks to that overworldbuilding as well.  The world is easy to visualize, and Tolkien has created rich cultures and races that you're immediately intrigued by.I picked up on a lot of themes that I see in fantasy today\u2014 friendship, the idea that power corrupts, and loyalty being the main ones. Those were also stronger aspects of the story.I've rated a few popular classics badly this year, and I've noticed a pattern in them. The characters tend to be very dry.  Fellowship definitely suffered from this as well, although I suppose fans would have a very different opinion.This is really a nitpick, but I felt it was worth mentioning. Fellowship was written in like, font size three. Everything, no matter how small, affects the reading experience, and I feel like text being that tiny makes the story feel longer and harder to read. You know, when the plot is a journey of the characters going from one place to their destination, stopping along the way, solving a problem, rinse and repeat? Yeah, it's a pet peeve of mine. Trekking doesn't interest me. It's not a plot, and it's boring. The screenwriters obviously took a lot of time on it and made it into a really enjoyable film that you want to love.But man, do I regret spending 50 bucks on a box set of the series. \"It's totally worth the investment,\" says Mr. Bookstore-Salesman, \"they're amazing!\" Then he proceeded to launch into a rant about Tom Bombadil not being in the movie, which I hadn't even watched at that point. I'll probably read the other ones sooner or later (but probably later) since I own them now. I mean, do they get better?If you love this book I completely see why, but it just wasn't for me. I probably won't be recommending it to anyone, but if you wanna just try out the first one to see if the writing works well with you I wouldn't advise against it.

Not the comic relief. Also Frodo is older than the usual fantasy hero, as was Bilbo before him, he is in his fifties which unless I'm wrong seems about equal to our thirty.

{"text": "\n           \n           Tolkien begins this classic trilogy by effectively bridging the related work, THE HOBBIT, and moving the story into new and exciting adventures. Bilbo Baggins is celebrating his eleventy-first birthday, coincidentally also the 33rd of distant cousin Frodo. When Bilbo agrees to leave his ring of invisibility to Frodo, Gandalf the Grey, wizard and chief counsel of all that should be done, discusses with the younger Baggins the importance of keeping its possession a secret. Frodo and his trusty helper, Sam, leave their home and trek out through Middle-Earth, careful to guard their ring and keep it out of the hands of those with evil aspirations. After a close-call attack, Frodo awakens with Gandalf at his side and many more surprises to be unveiled. At a meeting of the Council of Elrond, led by the elfin leadership, discussion of Frodo's ring and its origin takes up a great deal of time. Sauron, the Dark Lord, has succeeded in gathered all the Rings of Power, save one. The One Ring, being that which Frodo possesses remains out of his grasp and keeps him from ultimate power. Agreeing to trek across Middle-Earth to destroy the ring before Sauron can obtain it, Frodo and a small collection of fellow hobbits, men, and dwarves begin the long and daunting journey. Meeting friend and foe alike as they commence their journey, the small fellowship run into trouble and comic happenstance along the way. From a willow tree that takes no prisoners to a pack of wolves, and even the Black Riders who seek to intercept the ring, Frodo faces adversity at every turn. Tolkien pulls readers in from the get-go and takes them on a long and winding trip through Middle-Earth, sure to dazzle all who have the patience for the journey, which is nowhere near complete by the end of this book.Tolkien creates imagery that cannot be discounted by any reader. However, this attention to detail can bog the casual reader down, with its nuances and specificity. I admit to listening repeatedly to certain sections to retrieve their full meaning, paying special attention to ensure I understood the themes presented. I am neither a science-fiction nor a fantasy reader with any regularity, making this read an additional challenge for me. Tolkien has not only a way with words, but with the language of the fantasy genre. His creation of words, worlds, and characters of all shapes and sizes makes for a read like nothing I have encountered before, even in George RR Martin's classic series. I struggled and stumbled, but this should not be seen as a problem with the story, but simply its reader. I shall prevail, though my pace may leave even Frodo waving his hand to encourage continued momentum.Kudos, Mr. Tolkien for this entertaining and masterful piece of work.

{"text": "\n           \n           Most people already know what this is about, but here is a short summary for the people who don't: A Hobbit named Frodo gets a ring from his uncle. What they don't know is that this ring is the ring of 'The Enemy'. A dangerous journey starts where Frodo and his friends are chased by a group of Ring Wraiths and attacked by Orcs while trying to get to the Elven city Rivendell. After that their journey continues with more companions, more Orcs and more danger. I want to start off with saying that I am absolutely amazed by how Tolkien managed to come up with all of this. Most authors nowadays have fantasy stories to look back at for inspiration (not saying that they're stealing it), but Tolkien was the first who came with a fantasy story this well written and thought through, and the had nobody to look back at, which I think it absolutely genius. Even though I really liked this, I did expect to love it more than I actually did. As a massive fantasy lover I expected to be blown away by this, but I honestly wasn't, even though I do really like the story. There are probably two reasons for this: The first is that English isn't my first language and the English in this book is pretty difficult at moments, so it took me a pretty long time to read this book (around two weeks). The second reason is that the story is pretty slow. I thought there was waaaay too much talk about the journey and the environment, while there was a massive lack of talking at some moments, therefor I sometimes had to push myself through certain parts and actually just felt like skipping a few sentences, something I usually never do.The last minor point I had with this book was that the beginning of the book, where Frodo and his friends travel to Rivendell, was really long and took like 200 pages, while the second part felt kind of rushed and had a lot less environment explanations. I don't know if I am the only one who had that feeling while reading this, but I thought it just felt rushed. The biggest thing I liked about this book was that it's pretty different from the movie. The line of events is the pretty much the same, but the things that happen are kind of different. For example: In the movie Frodo leaves the Shire with Sam and later they run into Merry and Pippin, who are stealing food from a farmer, while in the book Frodo leaves with Sam AND Pippin and they actually stay at the farmers house, who gives them food and shelter, because he is friends with Pippin. Another change from the movie that I really liked was specifically how proud Legolas was of his people. He proudly tells the fellowship stories about the Elves and their history and sings their songs for them, something movie Legolas doesn't do.I overall actually really liked all the songs written in this book. I read that some people didn't like them and mostly just skipped past them, but I thought it was a really nice edition to the story and I read and enjoyed all of them. I overall really liked this book and recommend it to everybody who loves fantasy. Don't expect it to be the same as the movie though, because it's longer and quite different. I only can't give it a five stars, just because it read so slow for me. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Amber", "stars": "4", "date": "Aug 09, 15", "likes": "5"},

First, I want to start off by saying that I put off reading this book series for quiet some time. People had tried to convince me to read the books and I would always say I'll get to them eventually. Second, people had tried showing me the movies for years and I would fall asleep during them so it really did make me want to start the novels anytime soon. Lastly, it was only this year that I actually made it through all three movies and adored them! Yes, I finally saw all three movies and loved the. Yes, I saw the movies before reading the novels. Yes, I thought it was a better experience to do it this way. The Fellowship of the Ring is a heavy book, it's dense, and there's a lot of back story and lore that they give you along the way. I loved all of it but I think had I not known the main story line already while reading it I would have moved past all that lore and history quicker. The characters in the novel are so much more developed than they are in the movies. For example, I will be honest, I did not like Sam very much at all throughout the movie. I found him to not be that great at all. However, I loved him in the novel and the characters that I did love in the movie I only loved more in the novel! The adventure was the same throughout though, which I loved! The epic adventure of Frodo and the Fellowship was still just that, epic and adventurous. It is thick and dense as I stated before.

{"text": "\n           \n           Victory is mine. I finally did it. After years of beating around the bush, procrastinating, starting and stopping, I finally got this book read. If you haven't read Tolkien's opus, much of what you've probably heard is true. It's a gentle flowing story without an overwhelming sense of immediacy most of the time. The world is layered and textured at every turn. It seems not one corner of Tokien's Middle Earth was left uncovered by the author. It's a delight to read something that someone put so much thought and joy into creating. As for the plot\u2013\u2013there was a lot of walking. And a lot of camping. And a lot of talking. Peter Jackson pretty much wrote the book on how to adapt the epic for the big screen, and his first rule of thumb is to speed things up, and cut anything which isn't immediately necessary for the story. On the one hand, this definitely makes the story go faster, but on the other, it takes away some of the exploration and wonder of Tolkien's world. It's easy to see why fantasy writers all look to Tolkien: his sense of grandness, timelessness, and adventure gushes from the page. The experience of being immersed in this world with its magic, mountains, forests and rivers is pretty unique in literature.The prose style is very much like listening to someone tell you a story. At times this is very effective and at times it isn't. The adventurous moments take a bit of a hit from this, but the descriptions are that much more powerful because of it. I might have given the book five stars, but I'm wary to give those out unless the story in question is virtually perfect, and I was totally sucked in from page one until the end. Tolkien has written a masterpiece, no doubt, and the unbounded creativity on display here is in itself magical, but for all its goodness there was a few dry spells. And the film version does a few things better than Tolkien did. Even still, highly recommended, and four stars. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "A.J.", "stars": "4", "date": "May 03, 09", "likes": "4"},
{"text": "\n           \n            I have the greatest respect for J R.R. Tolkien. He is a legend to all authors \u2013 Adult, YA, Middle Grade or otherwise. He stepped out of the box and filled blank pages with true imagination. The imagination and devoted research, and sheer, obsessive attention to detail put into this book, he has made Middle-Earth a world as complex and enormous as our own. Just saying.So, this might be the toughest review I have written up-to-date. So, I\u2019d better start at the very beginning, when I first read the first part in the Lord of the Rings.That was my first try at LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring. I didn\u2019t rate it nor review it. I berried it deep from my memory and I never spoke about it ever again. But, later in my life, my life will once again intertwine with LOTR\u2026So now, here I am, after reading it once again, trying to say my feelings in the nicest way possible. \u2022 First off, I need to get this of my chest.  There. I said it. And it felt \u2022 Sam; you still rock.\u2022 It was so heavy and slow that it hurt me. \u2022 Don\u2019t take this the wrong way, I love description. It is a beautiful thing in writing, to see threw the authors eyes and see, smell, hear, touch his/her world. But to go down as to describe every leaf, stick and pebble as to give me headaches? \u2022 The characters (except Sam) didn\u2019t feel real. They didn\u2019t jump off the page. Yes, we learn about their past but none of them have an individual voice. They all sounded like the same person. Despite all these defaults, I loved the world of Middle-Earth. It\u2019s colour, it\u2019s history, is very entertaining and beautifully crafted.(By the way, I love the new movie-covers.

{"text": "\n           \n           Not to be confused with the movie, the book version of The Fellowship of the Ring includes several scenes with the mysterious, and quite possibly brain damaged, Tom Bombadil.On the positive side, Tom saves the hapless hobbits twice: first from Old Man Willow, an ancient and malevolent tree that lives on a toxic mix of Highballs and lost Halflings; and then, from a number of barrow-wights, evil soul-sucking undead creatures, not to be confused with Barry Wights, who are excellent, soulful (and unfortunately regular dead) singers of sexy songs. Speaking of song, Tom spends much of his time in a whimsical and poetic dreamscape of his own construction, singing as he passes blithely through the Old Wood. Tolkien tells us that he dresses in yellow boots and a blue jacket, leaving one to wonder if the author just forgot to mention if Tom was wearing pants, or if he is simply glossing over the lack of pants. I suspect that latter, because he does tell us that Tom has a long brown beard, bright blue eyes, and an extremely red face. Red face? Is Tolkien suggesting Tom is an alcoholic? It's hard to say. He acts kind of inebriated, given his propensity to speak in the bizarre poetry of a metre that is at best unconventional, and at worst, deranged. He also likes to talk about himself in the third person. This does not seem to annoy his wife, Goldberry. (Who may or may not be the spirit of the river Withywindle, but who is definitely some kind of saint for putting up with this narcissistic and enigmatic half-wit.)Bombadil is totally unaffected by the Ring, and he demonstrates this by doing a little sleight-of-hand, taking the ring from Frodo, and making it disappear in the air. (I suspect he palms it, but again, Tolkien does not tell us directly.) The One Ring doesn't make him invisible, and he doesn't seem to be influenced by Sauron through it. So why don't they just keep the ring hidden with Tom? It would have saved Frodo a painful stab-wound, massive existential angst, and having to endure Sam's repeated attempts at innuendo, by suggesting that he could really go for a nice bit of \"cony stew.\"Apart from the fact, that, hey, no trilogy, Gandalf suggests that because Tom is unaffected by the ring, he would probably not consider it important enough to protect. That's a nice way of saying he's a flighty (possibly pantsless) wanker. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Mark Rayner", "stars": "5", "date": "Dec 04, 13", "likes": "4"},

{"text": "\n           \n           This is epic - unfettered imagination - highly compelling literature. First, for the things I didn't care for: -The long and complicated names - I read this to the kids and, man, some of these are difficult to pronounce. The other languages were hard too. -All the songs - Ugh, these were a bit tiresome. The kids would actually ask for me to skip them.-And the over all feel of the journey was heavy-laden. There's no variation to the atmosphere - it's just one heavy, serious, and foreboding trek. Plod, plod, plod. But, man alive, the descriptions in this book are super, super good. Tolkien must have been a very interesting man to have had such an active imagination. I'm in awe of the Oxford companions: Lewis and Tolkien. These two friends must have had some pretty amazing conversations. As I mentioned, I read this to my older children (11 and 9) and they loved it, the whole way through. This is not easy reading, so how can kids be totally engrossed, and on the edge of the seats? Because, I think, the characters and setting are as vivid as it gets. And Tolkien is a master of suspense. There's also some great morals to the story: courage, responsibility, loyalty, friendship (fellowship), discerning of good and evil, and overcoming temptation. There's a lot of great talking points here. And the characters... wow. The characters. Gollum is a fascinating critter. And in the book you get the background on what he's all about. And the drama of this story is unparalleled with anything I've ever read. \"YOU SHALL NOT PASS!\" Whoa - that scene was intense. I was shouting, and my kids' eyes were buggin' out. It took us awhile to get through this narrative (like 3 or 4 months) - but it was worth it. I told my kids - when we finished tonight - 'it's the end of the book, but not the end of the story.' I gave them a choice - 'we can either take a break and read some other stuff or keep going with the series.' Well, they want to start The Two Towers later this evening.

{"text": "\n           \n           I read The Lord of the Rings multiple times as a kid, but haven't touched it in many years. Visiting it again in audiobook is a new experience (with a well-done narration, and even a recording of Tolkien himself at the beginning) not only for the format but because in between those readings and now have not only come the Peter Jackson movies, but also Lord of the Rings Online, both of which have had considerable impact on my memory of the story.It's quite amazing how much Jackson cut out of this book - almost half the events, I'd say. And almost all the singing - at times it felt like we were getting a little narration interrupting the songs. [Audio is really an excellent format for such a song-heavy book.]It's also startling how much Jackson added, or mixed about. Poor Farmer Maggot gets short shrift in the movie, but is both kind and wise in the book. Most of all, the movie is kinder to Boromir, who rarely gets to speak in the book except to make suggestions that everyone dismisses, but in the movie we have tiny touches (particularly the sword training scene) to round him out. Gimli and Legolas are also fairly faintly drawn in the text, while the movie plays up on humour and action. [Legolas, really, doesn't have much of a personality in any version.]And, oh, SO MANY paeons to the beauty of some immortal woman or another. At times this is not so much a tour of Middle Earth as a catalogue of ladies on pedestals.The other big impact to my experience of this book is playing the LOTRO MMO. That game places you 'just behind' the Fellowship, trailing in the wake of their eventful passing (and briefly catching up to them once or twice). It really really changes your experience of a book to have run quests back and forth and back and forth over every damn inch of the areas the Fellowship passed through, ducking boulders thrown by Ettins, and revisiting the Shire to race horses and do endless collection quests.So, well, worth revisiting the original text in this format.

There have been complaints that it is too long- winded, that it takes too long to get to a get to a decisive point. But I disagree. Yes, there is not much action in the beginning, but there is a lot of character development and background history that is beautiful and complex. There are so many side stories in this book, questions left unanswered. Some would argue that they are boring and besides the point, but I think it gives the book depth.

Digo que estou a ler Tolkien e vejo-o suceder com quem acompanha esta saga em simult\u00e2neo. E justifica-se: trata-se de um mundo \u00e0 parte, criado totalmente de raiz pelo escritor brit\u00e2nico. \u00c0 excep\u00e7\u00e3o da Lua e do Sol, nada parece estar no mesmo s\u00edtio. H\u00e1 criaturas m\u00edsticas, cen\u00e1rios inventados, lendas imaginadas, cantigas sobre her\u00f3is projectados pelo autor. V\u00e3o ouvir falar de um mundo de uma complexidade admir\u00e1vel que tem inspirado tantos autores desde ent\u00e3o: elfos, orcs, an\u00f5es, hobbits, feiticeiros, homens e esp\u00edritos. Tudo de modo t\u00e3o cred\u00edvel que as sombras que os amea\u00e7am e os movem pairam tamb\u00e9m sobre n\u00f3s. H\u00e1 uma viagem intermin\u00e1vel neste primeiro livro, t\u00e3o realista quanto as descri\u00e7\u00f5es do autor a tornam. H\u00e1 um mapa deste mundo que foi, por inteiro, imaginado pelo Tolkien. Cinco minutos de narra\u00e7\u00e3o deste \u00e9pico \u00e0 minha irm\u00e3zinha de seis anos foi suficiente para a manter entretida durante uma trilogia de quase quatro horas cada filme, antes de se deitar, a vivenciar realmente os receios, as fugas, as urg\u00eancias das personagens. E talvez ainda tomada pela emo\u00e7\u00e3o do culminar de mais de nove horas de filme e de uma banda sonora brilhante, em tudo adequada a esta epopeia, proponho-me a terminar a review do livro.Quase todo o livro \u00e9 uma viagem, uma campanha perigosa e fatal para alguns em direc\u00e7\u00e3o a Mordor, onde o malfadado anel deve ser destru\u00eddo. Da minha parte, cheguei a \u00be do livro convencida que lhe atribuiria um 4. \u00c0 semelhan\u00e7a dos filmes, em que achei o segundo e o terceiro muito mais emocionantes... Acontece que a excel\u00eancia da Irmandade do Anel \u00e9 indiscut\u00edvel, pelo que n\u00e3o me \u00e9 justo penalizar o autor se os seus tr\u00eas livros s\u00e3o nota 5, visto pessoalmente goste mais duns do que de outros... Muitos alicerces s\u00e3o estabelecidos neste livro em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 solidez do rumo da trilogia. As personagens s\u00e3o apresentadas: e arrisco dizer que nenhuma se modifica muito ao longo dos tr\u00eas livros. Sam, talvez - e como minha personagem favorita - passa de jardineiro t\u00edmido a melhor amigo empenhado, apostado em impedir Frodo de fraquejar. Os hobbits s\u00e3o um pouco caricatos, mas a seu tempo, e j\u00e1 neste volume, v\u00e3o dando mostras de grande fibra e coragem. Aragorn desdenha um pouco do poder, parece-me, mas n\u00e3o consegue desassociar-se do bem-estar do mundo dos homens, aonde poderia figurar como rei se o reclamasse. Gosto bastante do facto de o Gandalf evoluir em termos de poder, n\u00e3o come\u00e7a como um feiticeiro poderos\u00edssimo nem \u00e9 invenc\u00edvel. Nem costuma recorrer, t\u00e3o pouco, a grandes truques para se livrar de problemas. \u00c9 interessante o facto de ser um feiticeiro resmung\u00e3o e n\u00e3o o t\u00edpico velho sabich\u00e3o que tudo safa. O Gandalf tem d\u00favidas, fraquezas \u2013 de feiticeiro e de humano \u2013 e tantas vezes questiona e duvida do seu pr\u00f3prio ju\u00edzo. Pede conselho e tem pouco da arrog\u00e2ncia e inacessibilidade de outras personagens semelhantes no universo liter\u00e1rio e cinematogr\u00e1fico.Lamento que o Tolkien n\u00e3o tenha feito mais pelo Sam, creio que tem um papel muito mais importante do que o Frodo na trilogia. O Frodo segue o caminho que lhe apontam e que \u00e9 obrigado a abra\u00e7ar. Tirando no final deste primeiro livro, creio que n\u00e3o voltar\u00e1 a agir com sabedoria perante uma encruzilhada. Quanto ao Sam, este escolhe estar com o Frodo at\u00e9 ao fim; n\u00e3o tanto porque se identifique com a miss\u00e3o que foi atribu\u00edda ao amigo (e que lhe destruiria igualmente o Shire que tanto amam e partilham) mas porque toma aos ombros o fardo que \u00e9 totalmente do patr\u00e3o. Amizades destas, num livro - e sobretudo na vida real \u2013 s\u00e3o raras. Por isso reconhe\u00e7o-a e valorizo-a tanto como eixo chave sem o qual nem este primeiro volume nem os restantes enveredariam pelos trilhos em que caminham.\n         ", "book": "A Irmandade do Anel (O Senhor dos An\u00e9is, #1)", "user": "C\u00e9lia Loureiro", "stars": "5", "date": "Oct 09, 12", "likes": "3"},

{"text": "\n           \n           Once again, I have to resort to adding another edition of a book I've already read to denote a reread. I'm rereading The Lord of the Rings for an MA class -- Tolkien's Medievalism -- with a new awareness of Tolkien as a scholar (an awe-inspiring one) and of his sources and contemporaries. I don't have much new to note that I haven't said before, save that I've learnt to pay better attention to the verses now. (Parataxis is a feature of Old Norse sagas, too, but I think it was Poul Anderson's The Broken Sword that really convinced me.)In terms of stuff relevant to my class, it's mostly things like that -- style and form, the way it deals with characters -- that are drawn from medieval sources. \"Cynewulf and Cyneheard\" is suggested as a source for the fight in Moria, but that reading is only really apparent from a summary of events. The feel of it is quite different, and much of the detail.I also read it with a new eye, keeping in mind a friend's essay on , and the idea of \"Northern courage\" that Tolkien came up with, but that's more relevant to the other books. There are more obvious sources in The Hobbit and in those, I think.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Nikki", "stars": "5", "date": "Oct 31, 11", "likes": "3"},
{"text": "\n           \n           Not my favorite author, but definitely worth reading. His style is paced very slow, with more than his fair share of tangents, but all in all this story is one of the best ever written. What others have said and continue to say about characters, about things revealed by the author of character motivation, Point of view shifts and so on are all based on the ideas of modern writing style. They are new developments and shouldn't be applied to Tolkien. And furthermore, that is not what this story is about. This isn't a character story, or at least that wasn't the point. Characters are obviously included but they were not the point. You beg to differ? Well the cardinal rule of character stories is that they end when the characters have reached their turning point. This story doesn't do that, thats why it continues for whole chapters in the cleaning of the shire even though the main plot has clearly ended. Character stories don't do that. There more like this; Jane finally stands up for herself after getting pushed around by everyone, Joe finally finds it in himself to face his father, etc etc... And when those things happen the story ends. This isn't about that. So to say their wasn't enough characterization or that the characters were card board cutouts and base your whole opinion of the book on that, is to miss the point of this story entirely. And thats your right, thats fine. This type of story isn't for you. This story is easily classified as a Milieu story. ITS ABOUT THE WORLD the characters live in and not really about the characters at all. The characters are merely the excuse to show the reader the world. Thats the point. Tolkien spent decades inventing this world, creating nearly complete languages and backstory that goes on and and on and on. This little tale of the the ring is just the tip of that massive juggernaught iceberg. All meant as a means to an end, To Explore that massive world he created.

There's no Old Man Willow and no Tom Bombadil here, for example. Still, it is a very full telling -- surprisingly so. I first listened to these tapes when I was little, and borrowed my grandmother's copies. Eventually I got my own, but I still haven't listened to them all. Now's the time, I guess.I think it was an extremely well-cast, well-edited bit of work. Some of it throws me now -- like Ian Holm playing Frodo, since he played Bilbo in the films -- but there are very few of the voices I don't like. I especially like Gandalf's voice. I was never very fond of Aragorn's, though it grows to sound more natural the more you hear it, and I never found that Legolas was really distinctive enough to pick him out of the background. Hopefully that'll change when I get onto The Two Towers.I do like how much they kept in of the background of the world -- the songs, mostly, most of them set to music. I love Sam's 'Gil-galad', and 'Seek for the Sword That Was Broken'.

And trust me, you will fall in love with  right after your mind gets to travel into The Shire in the first few chapters of the first book.It is true that The Lord of the Rings is quite a weighty tome, especially due to s faible for in-depth descriptions of the Fellowships journey, the fantastical world around them and the myths, songs and legends that come with it. But after some getting used to you are going to love his elaborateness and you're going to find yourself trying to soak in all the details that you can get about Middle Earth - because the world seems so real, magical, terrible and wonderful all at the same time. I think Tolkiens accuracy just goes to show how very much alive this made-up world was inside of is head and how infatuated he was with it. And I, as a reader, felt the same way after a very short amount of time.You do not only get lost in the world itself while reading this book, but also in the story, which is narrated brilliantly and certainly enthralling. As the first part of the series,  starts of quiet slow and peacefully and serves as a wonderful introduction for the overall story, the world and the characters (especially if you are, like me, not very fond of epic battles and in-depth fight scenes).Yet, in these first two books, the author unfortunately does not manage to make the individual characters seem as carefully developed and complex as the world around them. But since  is so brilliant and addictive, I do have high hopes for the following four books of The Lord of the Rings.Overall, this book is an absolute must-read and a masterpiece of world-building and narration.

It is truly genius.When reading this book you cannot and I mean CANNOT rush it. You must have the time to read and enjoy the imagery which does get a little boggy especially in this one. But if you take your time it actually goes much faster and you don't miss as much. I absolutely ADORE how Mr. Tolkien describes the Hobbits! They are such sweet, innocent, laid back people. But they are all unique. I also like how all the races differ from one another. It is hard to make up a bunch of different races and then make them their own, not to mention making up an entire language for them!!The plot is one that we have heard a thousand times. There's a bad guy, we have to go on quest to stop him sorta thing. But this one is totally different from any onther adventure story out there. They way the plot unfolds and exspands is so wonderfully its one! Truly Mr. Tolkien was inspired by Providence! The one complaint I have about this book is that it is very, very slow in places. And Mr. Tolkien seems to think we want to know that the characters are feeling extremely depressed. Then takes two paragraphs to describe it!! That is my one and only complaint!

{"text": "\n           \n           *3.5 Stars*I'm quite divided on this one. It's rare that I say a film adaption is better than the book, but I find myself feeling that to be the case with this.One of the issues I was having was the abundance of needless description and imagery. I never knew there were so many different ways to describe leaves, tress and mountains. At times in the story it works, and is clearly necessary\u2014but at others it's just too heavy and seems to slow things down. I'm well aware that Tolkien was aiming to create Middle-Earth to be a vivid landscape that the reader can truly appreciate\u2014and I did\u2014but it can cause you (or me, at least) to suddenly lose interest and struggle to take the story in. At times like this, I found myself reading some paragraphs on autopilot; staring through the pages in a daydream; reading the words but not taking them in. This was at times a difficulty to endure. The book could quite easily have been 100 pages shorter and probably more effective.That's what really influenced my rating on this book. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy it for the most part, but those good, enticing moments were just not common enough. I found myself reading 300 detailed pages of Frodo's journey, step for step (literally), and about 100 pages of storyline.I can clearly see why Tolkien's work has accrued such a huge following, and I feel it's a magnificent world in which he has created, especially given the era it was written, but I had to ask myself once I placed the book down: \"did I REALLY enjoy this book? Like, '5 star' enjoy it?\" And, unfortunately, the answer to that question was no.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Jake Hartnett", "stars": "4", "date": "Apr 28, 15", "likes": "2"},
{"text": "\n           \n           The Fellowship of the Ring | J.R.R Tolkien | 398 pages | Classic The Fellowship of the Ring follows a hobbit named Frodo, who has inherited a very powerful, and very dangerous ring. I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand I loved it but I also had some problems with it that are very hard to ignore. There are three main things ( in my opinion ) that make a book enjoyable. And that's being able to relate to the characters, writing style, and the story itself. I absolutely loved J.R.R Tolkien's writing style. He has amazing quotes that I really wished that I had marked in my book. There was one that really stuck in my mind and I've heard it before but I never knew that he wrote it! And its \"Not all those who wander are lost.\"  The problems I had with this book was relating to the characters and the story itself. I just really couldn't relate to Frodo at all. And the story felt like it took forever for them to actually be legit on a quest. I mean they spent half of the book just running away! My favorite part was when Gandolf was telling Frodo the story of how Golum came by the ring and how we got to hear more of his backstory.

Gandalf tiene sus momentos pero bueno no me encanta mientras que Aragorn, Legolas y Gimli son estupendos y me encanta la personalidad que tienen ellos.y bueno un 5 de 5 porque es un libro que me ha encantado mucho\n         ", "book": "La comunidad del anillo (El Se\u00f1or de los Anillos, #1)", "user": "Cookiesoni", "stars": "5", "date": "Jan 03, 15", "likes": "2"},

{"text": "\n           \n           After finishing this book I felt a great disappointment. Certainly not in the story, the characters or the author but in myself. Why - HOW - has it taken me this long to begin the LOTR trilogy? We've had the books for a while since my wife has been a life-long fan but I simply never read them, saying they just weren't my \"thing.\" She finally talked me into reading the Hobbit a few months before the first film was released and I loved it - I easily saw why it was one of her favorite books, and while I wasn't yet sold on LOTR I was now closer - the seed had been planted, if you will.I entered the world of Middle Earth with a little knowledge based on the fact that I have sort-of half watched the three films based on these books. This was helpful in that it made visualizing these places and these characters a bit more but just like any book there are several differences from the film adaptations. Without going through a full list of these things I can say that after reading the first book, Frodo is not as annoying as he's portrayed in the films, Aragorn is more admirable in the book than I remember him being in the movies, Merry and Pippin have not seemed as rambunctious and careless as I remember them being in the films and Gandalf has resumed his role from the Hobbit of powerful, knowledgable guy that's seems to make people think and work way harder than you'd imagine he would. I suppose my knowledge of wizards from other universes - say those found in Hogwarts - have made me think of wizards as beings that have no problem using their powers to make their lives easier. While Gandalf saves the day on multiple occasions, if I were in the Fellowship I would be disappointed in his lack of wizarding.In all seriousness, though, this book - the first in the trilogy - was fabulous. The characters, environments and adventures Tolkien has created are nothing short of marvelous. I especially enjoyed the map of Middle Earth included in the back of this edition of The Fellowship of the Ring as I referenced it at least after every chapter, often more frequently.

First, I didn't know that Sean Bean was Boromir. I mean...I knew he was in the movie because of those memes, but I didn't know who he played. I also thought Boromir was a dwarf.I wasn't exactly sure who Pippin and Merry were besides being hobbits, but now I know.I also wasn't expecting such a slow, relatively uneventful first half of this novel. The whole book is littered with random poems and songs, which I'm not a fan of. So I glaze over whatever is italicized or lyrical. No offense to Mr. Tolkien, but I'm just not about that life.Let me tell you, I think the book could've been shorter by about 150 pages if it weren't so wordy and rife with unnecessary details about the hobbits' initial adventure. The second half, when the Fellowship has been rounded up, was a more compelling read. Got spookier, actually.The mythology of the Lord of the Rings has always been fascinating, and we owe that to the mystery that Tolkien cloaks the details in. He doesn't give full stories. He mentions things, hashes it out a bit, then just leaves it. I like how he incorporates whatever he can into the novel--the way he brings in nature itself as a character, that can side with good or evil or stay neutral. He lets his characters get in touch with their id, ego, and superego. There is a lot going on in these books, but I'm afraid all my skimming made me miss some details.

{"text": "\n           \n           The Fellowship of the Ring is a wonderful beginning to an epically-crafted world. This was my second time reading the novel and I enjoyed it even more. Tolkien's writing is, as always, elegant. The characters were all diverse and Middle Earth is beautiful. Mr. Tolkien's world-building is astounding.I appreciated hobbit society this time around. There were so many things I missed the first time I read this and I'm very glad I reread The Fellowship of the Ring. To anyone paying attention, this is a thought-provoking novel when you think about the world of Middle Earth and its inhabitants.There are a few things that really stood out to me but the one that was probably the most powerful was the fact that Gandalf, even with his knowledge of the Ring's nature, never took Bilbo's choice away. He allowed Bilbo to choose to let go of the Ring. That, to me, is a significant reflection on his character.Another thing that has stayed with me is Aragorn's character. For some reason, never realized he wasn't just the noble, yet mysterious character he's usually perceived as. Surprisingly, I found him to be pretty charming and enjoyed his smiles. ;) I also enjoyed just watching the hobbits all come in to themselves. Of course, Gandalf is awesome. Legolas and Gimili somehow managed to leave an impression even though they really didn't play a very big role. Honestly, Boromir probably had more dialogue than them.Speaking of Boromir.... he seems to be the character I want to see as noble but I struggle to see him as such. This is greatly because of the Ring's influence though because there are moments where you see his chivalry shine through. The fact that Boromir was so easily influenced by the object doesn't help him in my mind. To me, he remains the character that I think I probably would have liked more before he'd come within reach of the Ring's power. As for the rest of it, the Nazgul and Gollum were both perfectly fit for their creepy roles. Honestly, I had my moments where I myself was looking over my shoulder.

It seems to focus mostly on the land. Where this river heads, what color the leaves are here. The details chosen to focus on are mostly pointless, boring.Meanwhile, the characters are hardly fleshed out if at all, almost completely one-dimensional, and still, some of them (Gandalf especially) come off as inconsistent.Despite the mature, historical tone, there are odd bits of whimsy thrown in; chiefly, the garden-gnome/nature god Tom Bombadil. Who mostly, just really likes singing about himself.The book also features many 'songs', long, graceless poems, that are usually tangentially related to the story, at best.Foreshadowing is under-used, and when used, is extremely heavy-handed.There are a couple of really interesting parts, mostly focused around 'the eye', but mostly, this story reads like it was hammered out on a typewriter, and edited only for proof.

I learned that sometimes, even though you don't want to, you have to do things. When Frodo takes the burden of destroying the ring, he knew he didn't have to. There were a lot of stronger and experienced men who could have taken the initiative at the meeting. But Frodo did it because he knew it was the right thing to do. In the book J.R.R. Tolkein expresses Frodo's emotion perfectly. Although at times this book can go on and on with description it is worth reading it. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat long after you have turned the last page. The way Tolkein paints a picture in your mind of what is happening in the book is the only reason the movies were such a hit. There is no way the movies could have been made if Tolkein had not spent his time writing, re-writing and editing this book until it was perfect.

{"text": "\n           \n           ORIGINALLY POSTED AT .Refers to entire series:J.R.R. Tolkien was the master of fantasy, and that's not just because he was the first to write a very popular modern epic.What makes Tolkien superior was how he used his extensive knowledge of mythology and linguistics to create his own complex world. He was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College where he studied and taught the linguistics of early English. Over many years he created his own elvish language with a complex syntax and grammar, and a complete history and mythology of Middle Earth (see the twelve volumes of The Histories of Middle-Earth below.) This gives his works so much complexity and texture that when you read them, you feel like you've dropped into the middle of a real civilization.Besides the amazing world-building, Tolkien builds excellent characters and uses them to explore such heavy human themes as friendship, love, greed, power, redemption, gender-roles, self-sacrifice, and death. This is not a light epic for a Sunday afternoon. This is intense, bone-chilling, goose-bump raising stuff. You can feel the weight of the world on the shoulders of Frodo and his companions. And, though there's a happy ending, it comes with much suffering and loss.And all the while, Tolkien's writing is beautiful and poignant.

The first act drags and has no sense of urgency at all. This problem is accentuated by a section containing Tom Bombadil that is nothing more than sheer filler and a good example of why editors are important. The story picks up in the second act in Bree, and this is where the book is enjoyable, as the pacing through Bree, Weathertop, and Moria is flawless. Unfortunately, Tolkien slams on the brakes at several parts of the third act, making one wonder whether or not he wants the reader to have fun reading this book at all. Anytime the novel gets any forward momentum and becomes enjoyable, Tolkien throws some detour in the story, which brings everything to a halt, and the book becomes boring again. I wonder whether or not it was Tolkien himself who originally said, \"I had fun once. It was awful.\" By itself, the story is a good one, accentuated by massive amounts of lore and backstory Tolkien has built into the world of Middle Earth to make it more believable.

I tried multiple times before to get into it but each time lost interest. Not this time. I found it surprisingly easy to read, while I had struggled with the prose before. And, not to toot my own horn, I feel like that shows personal growth in a way, since I've been reading so much lately.As far as The Lord of the Rings goes, it's such an epic story. As a fantasy lover, you can't not like the story. I've seen the movies upwards of ten times, probably, as my family used to have all day LotR marathons. Which I will be repeating once I've finished reading the books.And yes, because I saw the movies before reading the books, my judgment is tainted. I know. But I can't help but feel like the movies are actually better than the books. This stems from a few important points.Seriously though. The pacing is . I was so confused reading it, especially when I was past halfway and they hadn't even reached  yet. The whole scene with Tom Bombadil was so exhausting, I'm glad that was cut from the movie... But other than that, when they finally reached Rivendell, they seriously had 40 pages of almost pure dialogue, the Council. And then other scenes were really short. It all just felt a bit weird.This was a seriously disappointing point. I thought that the book, which I always heard has \"really long descriptions\", would provide amazing character depth. And that's a really important element for me to be truly in love with a series. But here because there were so many characters, I found them all to be a bit lacking in the personality department. While there were really long descriptive paragraphs about the settings and the trees and the rocks and whatever, I just longed for character descriptives. The third person omniscient narration also contributes to the detachment. So anyway, I approve of the depth that we see in the movies and missed that here.Seriously. I don't know how much I can say about this. But I can't repeat it enough. The songs are annoying. It feels like filler material. Usually it adds nothing to the story. And it just felt awkward reading this poetry, which sometimes came off as corny rhymes. Anyway. I don't regret at all reading it. It's definitely worth a read. But I can understand why a lot of people struggle with it and give up. It's not as beautifully written as one would expect of a story of this caliber.

{"text": "\n           \n           For one thing, my review is really for the set of three books; they are really one long work broken into smaller parts, and the structure is not quite so awful if you look at it that way. This is a must-read for all lovers of Fantasy, although I definitely don't think it's going to be to everyone's taste, despite the semi-recent popularity of the movies. The heroes seem very British to me (the aristocratic, land-owning Frodo \"suffering\" in nobility--and the most American character is the somewhat whiny Sam, who actually *does* things and is, literally, a man of the earth) the pacing is up and down, and overall the characterization takes a back seat to the world building.

Actually, there was some misunderstanding. I thought I just had to read , but it turns out I'm granted a movie for every book I read . . . so. Now, 530 pages later, I can watch the first four hours. Great. Just another thousand pages and I should be all set for our next marathon.

I'm going to picture her now, and ignore everything you describe, Mister Tolkien. Also, I will become enraged at no one in particular when you describe something that  in the movie. What! Why wasn't this in here? Who's this lumberjack? Did you know the fellowship spent a few  in Moria? I feel betrayed! By . . . no one. I don't know! I'm confused!And hey, I should mention, skimming isn't all that it's cracked up to be. It makes reading feel like the job where you're just staring at the clock, wondering when the hands will magically dictate that your \"work time\" is now over. Skimming is like reading Facebook updates at work: you feel a sort of cheating thrill, but mostly you feel sad that it has come to this. The moral of the story, kids, is read the book first. In the past. Make sure to have read the books when you were a kid, so you can watch the movies now, which are awesome and all you really want to do on any given weekend night -- especially with the commentary about how they did all the skulls rolling down the mountain!

I thought all the historical references just gave such richness to the story, and really made their whole world believable. It really made it seem that they were fighting for something that needed saving, and was worth saving. I just love how it contains such great metaphors for our own real lives, even without elves and magic and remarkable adventures and horrible evils. It is just nice to be reminded that vast amounts of time are needed to accomplish anything great.

This ring, though, contains evil powers and if the creator of the ring, Sauron, regains control of it, he could unleash desruction and chaos. Frodo, realizing the power of the ring, sets off with a group to destroy it. The road ahead is not easy for him, though. Many perils and obstacles lie in his path. Can he overcome them?I found this book to be a great read. It is told in the form of a narrative. A couple of great themes for this book are \"courage\" and \"the power of friendship\". Being a narrative, most of the story is told in third person and characterization is done directly. There are a couple of things that may discourage people from reading this book. The first is old english. At first, I had a hard time understanding what \"hither\" and \"thither\" meant, but when read in context is easy to understand. Another problem is length. Some people may feel the book is too long or drag on.

This book has obviously given inspiration to many people, and because of this, the whole book rings absolutely clich\u00e9 to me. I know this to be false, but that's just how it is. The thought of wizards and elf-like people conversing about magic rings with dragons flying over head just makes me laugh now.Secondly, the history of hobbits is completely uninteresting. I stopped several times and actually thought picking up my Bible and reading Genesis and all the genealogies in the Old Testament would be more interesting than the history of hobbits.I can understand the love for these books, but I find it weak. To me the world is entertaining enough, and people have endless possibilities. So why then I would need such an in-depth fantasy world? Sometimes I just think I lack the imagination, though.(I understand the irony of my mentioning the Bible of all things, and now I kind of wish I had not. But the differences between a holy text and a fantasy novel, I should hope, are obvious).Basically: another book not for me.***The cover of my version is not quite as gay, thank god, but the ISBN shown this version so I'll go with it until I find the correct one.I do not expect to like this.

{"text": "\n           \n           It's been a long time since I reread Lord of the Rings, but it felt like time, with a lot of things reminding me of it lately. The last straw was reading about Ursula Le Guin's thoughts on it in Cheek By Jowl. Since the last time I read it, I've heard a lot of hard words about LOTR -- about the terrible writing and the terrible pacing and the xenophobia and the lack of moral grey area and all of that, and reading it again I notice faults in it that I'd never have admitted when I was younger, but I also remember all the ways I think people are wrong about it. However, an overview of the trilogy can wait! For now, I'll review The Fellowship of the Ring alone.It starts off very slow, set in The Shire, giving us a glimpse of the peaceful happy life that Bilbo longed for so often during The Hobbit, and building up the tension slowly. Slowly seems to be the key word in this book, in fact. I forgot that it takes the whole first 'book', which probably has almost as many words as The Hobbit, to get as far as Rivendell. One thing you can't accuse Tolkien of is rushing. A lot happens in that time, really, including the introduction of the Nine and of Strider/Aragorn, which is important... but it's such a small step, The Shire to Rivendell, that some people dismiss it as pointless. I can't see as much point in the part with the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil... it feels like a digression, as if Tolkien is in love with his world and wants to show us more of it. I like that part, but I can see why people don't.The second half of the book feels more purposeful. Frodo learns more and knows more clearly what he's going to have to do, and we learn about the Company. And then -- eventually -- they get under way. I suppose that really they don't do that much more in the second book -- in the first book there's the Shire, the Old Forest, The Prancing Pony, and Weathertop, and in the second book there's Rivendell, Caradhras, Moria, Lothlorien and the Anduin. But things feel more imperative and desperate, I suppose. And things keep speeding up from here.I can't decide what my favourite part is. The Lorien part is beautiful, but obvious. The Moria part is dark, but I think maybe I like that best because of Balin, and in honour of Gandalf. My favourite characters are... hmm. Gandalf, Sam and Aragorn, probably, although it's nice to see Bilbo again. And I wish we knew more about Glorfindel, actually -- that he'd gone with the company, or something, because I think more could've been done with him. He appeared and disappeared quite quickly.In any case, yes: I can see the flaws in the writing, and I'm beginning to see what's meant by the xenophobia -- I missed that, through not being a very subtle reader when I last read it, I think. I didn't look beyond the face value.

The Fellowship of the Ring, while very old, is an amazing book. Its author, JRR Tolkien, forged a whole universe inside of his novels, which he wrote to be thought of as a version of England's nonexistent mythology. While the book is fairly slow at first and there are a few scenes which drag on, like the never ending council of Elrond, the book brings an amazing sense of detail and reality to the reader. Many times in the book, characters or references are not explained, which may be very confusing to a Lord of the Rings newbie, but knowing a lot of the lore I found the book amazing.

{"text": "\n           \n           The Fellowship of the Ring written by J.R.R Tolkien is about a young hobbit going to destroy a ring of evil powers. The story starts off by Gandalf telling Frodo to take the ring and destroy it. Frodo and Gandalf are one of many main characters in the book. Gandalf warns Frodo not to put on the ring. \"The journey will be one full of peril.\" Gandalf tells Frodo but Frodo agrees to the journey. Along the way he crosses trouble and decides to put on the ring a couple of times but ultimately he doesn't too much after because when he does he sees terrible things. Some themes of the story are that to stay committed to a certain goal. Even though the goal might be hard to reach it will be a good outcome at the end.

He would change the settings really quick and you wouldn't know where you were unless you read some more. Another subject he could have done better on is describing the enemy more.

Tolkien's prose is so ineffably classic; the descriptions of his universe are so warm and poetic, there is a constant fantastical glaze over everything you read. The world building alone is so massive that it's difficult not to feel the legitimacy and realness of the places he describes. Directly comparing it to the other large-scale fantasy series I've read-- -- it's easy to mistake Tolkien's world for being less vivid: whereas GRRM is writing a universe that is essentially medieval Europe touched with bits of the supernatural, Tolkien created a world of different races, otherworldly foes, and perpetual magic. That being said, even though LOTR has the flavor of a fairy tale, it's still incredibly engrossing and dark.It should be mentioned, though, that this book took me far too long to complete. Tolkien's prose is like NyQuil; sometimes I could barely trudge my way through a page and a half before falling asleep.

The story follows a young hobbit, a creature from Middle-Earth, in his journey through Middle-Earth to destroy the One Ring, which has the power to pretty much destroy the world if it falls into the wrong hands (cough, Sauron, cough, bad guy, cough). Unfortunately, the only place where they can destroy it is the Crack of Doom (best name ever), which unfortunately, is right in the middle of Sauron\u2019s domain. Tough luck.  Despite the book being quite long, and what most people might call boring, just keep on reading. It gets wayyy better once you actually get into it. It might be long and descriptive, but it\u2019s not so bad. There is a slight bit of violence, smoking, and drinking, but only a little. Other than that, it\u2019s worth slogging through all the boring parts, because the plot can actually get really intense later on. It\u2019s a bit slow near the beginning, but don\u2019t let that stop you from getting to the good parts.  It\u2019s a great book, because, despite all the negative points I\u2019ve already touched upon, it truly delivers a fantastic representation of the world Tolkien created. It would be great for kids too because it has a wonderful sense of right and wrong, making it easier for the person reading it to be able to discern right from wrong earlier on. Pretty much every single character struggles with some sort of moral struggle somewhere, but in the end, they always learn good character values that a young child can easily learn from. Overall, The Fellowship of the Ring can be a great influence on children and it should not be banned in any way. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring", "user": "JAMIE!!!1!!", "stars": "4", "date": "May 27, 15", "likes": "1"},

I see Tolkien's interpretation of the Kingdom and how the good of it, the hope of it, in fact the very illumination/radiance of it, will spread to the ends of the earth and will be accomplished despite growing evil. Also, this Kingdom will advance through very unlikely means and unlikely individuals! One of my favorite lines was from Gandalf after Frodo wishes the ring hadn't come to him:\"So do I, and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for us to decide.

{"text": "\n           \n           Frodo Baggins, the nephew of the great Bilbo Baggins, was a little more imaginative than all of the others his age he wanted to travel past the shire one a great quest like the one that his uncle had went on many years prier. He would spend most of his time with is uncle listening to the stories of the dragons, elves and the company of dwarves. Meanwhile the darkest and most evil thing that has ever existed regains his power and his armies. To take over all of middle earth. The little hobbit gets mixed in with the fight against the evil that threatens the world. \tIt starts with the wizard Gandalf the gray finding out the magic ring that Bilbo had taken when he was on the quest with the dwarves was the ring of power. It had the ability to make the Dark Lord whole. The only way to stop the war and save the world is to throw the ring into the fires of mount doom where the ring was created. Frodo must make his way to Rivendell and seek the guidance of the elf lord Elrond. It is there that the fellow ship of the ring is born and the companions that will help him to the end.\tThe theme is that the good in the world will shine through the darkness and that if you have courage that you can persevere. This is the first book of the lord of the rings trilogy. It gets off to a slow start but really sets the tone for the rest of the books in the trilogy. I would recommend that you read this book and the rest of the trilogy.

{"text": "\n           \n           The story Lord of the rings continues the adventures of the Hobbit and we meet Bilbo\u2019s nephew. The book starts out with Bilbo Baggins and the hype for his birthday party, right in the middle of the party bilbo disappears out of the blue ( a scripted joke of course). As a going away present bilbo gives frodo the ring (from the Hobbit) then after bilbo leave the shire strange things start happening and frodo gets a thirst for adventure. Then the journey starts, frodo and three of his hobbit friends travel the the center of Mordor, the only place the ring can be destroyed. Frodo encounters many foes that test his morals.In my opinion J.R.R Tolkien did a wonderful job writing the book, the images i got well read the book were vivid. His style of writing had me show my emotion as i read, lots of my friends made fun of the way goofily smiled as read more and more of the book. Although some times it felt as though i didn't need this much detail for the book, some part tended to be rather slow. You kind of have to trudge through the slow parts and something J.R.R Tolkien put little gems that were funny in the long paragraphs. The major messages that J.R.R Tolkien is that power is corrupted and unneeded, he doesn't this by show how the ring works on the people who chose to wear it. Everyone who wears it is controlled by the ring and they turn hostile when the see someone who can take the ring away. J.R.R Tolkien shows us the dangers of power and the appeal to it, the main character is a simple hobbit and then through just being a good person he is a hero.My overall impression of the book was that is was a truly entertaining book and it teaches a lot of important lessons. The main themes are , it is never too late too do the right thing, and absolute power corrupts. The book will get you thinking and i would recommend it to someone who needs to get a wake up call but also wants to entertained. The book got me thinking about how even though some paths are easy, the best ones take time and are far more rewarding, I bet if you read the book you have a better perspective on your day to day life.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Swetha-krishnamoorthy-8", "stars": "5", "date": "May 28, 15", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           \tWhat is a hobbit? If you have to ask this question then I think you need to rethink your life, take a moment, walk outside, contemplate life, realize your failure as a human having not read Lord of the Rings. Now instead of reading this review go to your local library, check out this book and spend the rest of your evening finding out what, in fact, a hobbit is. Got to say this one is a little bit of a time commitment though. If you have to read a book in a week for a review for school, well to put it in the words of the beloved wizard Gandalf the Grey \u201cYOU SHALL NOT PASS\u201d.Now if you didn't take my advice or you have already read this great novel then by all means keep reading, grab a cup of joe, a warm glass of milk, whatever you Goodreaders drink, and prepare yourself for a very \u201cinsightful\u2019 review of the Fellowship of the Ring.\tIf you don't know what a hobbit is or you have watched the movies and don't really know what a hobbit is then here you go. To understand a few of your main characters ( and simply the beginning of the story) you need to know that the hobbits as a whole are very isolationist, they don't explore, they don't wonder, they just live their simple hobbit lives. Now there are outliers like the well know Bilbo Baggins and the lesser know Bandobras \u201cBullroarer\u201d Took. But hobbits as a whole don't make a point in knowing the geography of Middle-Earth or whose rule they live under, they are a simple, oblivious people.\tYou see, the main character of the Fellowship of the Ring is Frodo Baggins,a hobbit, who has never once left the shire since he first arrived as a child, he was in for quite the change of scenery. At his uncle Bilbos birthday a wizard named Gandalf arrives as a guest of Bilbos and discovers that among Bilbo's possessions there is a ring of tremendous power. After researching the ring Gandalf returns and entrusts it to Frodo ( Bilbo has since left for rivendell,city of the elves, for retirement). After Discovering that foul creatures named ringwraiths have started to hunt him Frodo, who is( rather inconveniently) in the process of moving to a different home in a town named cricket hollow, decides to flee for Bree to find Gandalf and give him the ring. He doesn't yet realize his journey will take him much farther than Bree.\tThis book is, I believe, a basic good versus evil story at its root but with a whole lot more to it than that. I believe it is a personal journey of sorts. It leads you through a vast and unforgettable world, you follow the personal development of many lovable (and detestable) characters, and most importantly you grow. Yes I did just say that a book of all things makes you grow. Its a story of a desperate fight versus evil but it also provides insight into what it means to be noble, the corrupting powers of greed, and the personal emotions of hero who may very well die at any moment, putting his life on the line for the well being of everyone in the world. You don't find that type of commitment and profoundness in stories like twilight or the hunger games. This is the real deal, as fine as books come.\tWhat lead me to this series was viewing the films as a child I watched the third movie in the theater and as I walked out of that theater I knew that I need to read these books. I never did decide to read them until freshmen year in High school. Immediately realizing that the maturity needed to read the series was beyond my own, I still decided to persisted on. Now as a junior I decided to read it again for school. The first time I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would, it was slow, long, and dry at parts, not the action packed book my expectations had lead me to believe. Reading it that second time I picked up on all those little details that had be passed over the first time, and realizing all the deeper meanings, I was blown away to say the least. I found myself identifying with the character Boromir of Gondor, a strong, prideful man who was known for his heroic brashness and charisma. I didn't Identify with him because of the attributes I listed though. I identified with him because of his mannerisms, his personality, and his way of speaking and thinking. His story-line is very interesting one I will let your read for yourself. I think that everyone should read the Lord of the Rings series once in their life if not twice, not only for the stories it tells but for the lessons that it teaches so eloquently. Now everyone might not enjoy this book, especially people with a short attention span, but I think that those with a passion to learn should read the story. When I read this story I got exactly what I had hoped for action, intrigue, incite, and one heck of a ride. I hope that you find these things in the book as well when you shut off your computer, go to the library right now, and check out this book as I recommended at the beginning.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Dalon Koubek", "stars": "5", "date": "Mar 04, 15", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           It's just impossible for me to rate this anything other than 5 stars, I mean, it's Lord of the Rings!!! Ok, so I got a bit bored by the lack of action and I didn't realise how different the films were from the book, but no matter I still enjoyed reading this. After watching the films first and then reading the book you get a much clearer insight into the world of hobbits and elves and orcs which the film cannot give you. Tolkien is a master at worldbuilding. I also loved the collection of songs he created, it really drops you right into this spectacular fully formed world where you can become completely immersed. I think a combination of the book, split into three parts, and films are best as the book gives you the history of the people and a much wider view of middle-earth, but the films give you the action missing in this first part. Obviously going to continue with the rest of the sections of this book and the rest of Tolkiens work, he has created something so intense that probably cannot be replicated. I just loved this book, even though it wasn't what I was expecting and was rather slow-paced. At some points it does lag as the journey seems to be never-ending, but then they arrive in Bree and things get more entertaining. I also loved the relationships between the different races which I think also lends believability to this world. Tolkiens skills as a linguist and his portrayal of a deep, rich history makes up for the lack of action.

{"text": "\n           \n            I thought the book was good. I particularly like fantasy and fiction and this books story line really hooked me in. Some of the parts were boring or repetitive. There were parts that just repeated what happened. When they were running away from the black riders through the shire it became repetitive when they just stopped at everyone's house and were worried about the time and leaving.  The story is about the ring, and a journey by a hobbit. It begins in the shire on a birthday Bilbo Baggins\u2019 birthday. Bilbo has a plan to leave at this party. He intends to give a something he holds very close to him to Frodo. Bilbo was considered a strange person always going off for long periods of time and returning randomly. On one of these adventures he found the ring. This was the object he intended on leaving Frodo. Frodo was much like Bilbo being adventurous but he never intended on leaving the Shire. At this time a war was breaking out the orcs were taking over. When Frodo inherited the ring he didn\u2019t know what to do with it. Gandalf a wizard told him to keep it hidden until he figured out what it was. Gandalf the Grey was a one of the five wizards in middle earth. To the hobbits he was a strange man but to outsiders his name was well known. Gandalf told Frodo that he needed to take the ring to mount doom to destroy it. Frodo said he was incapable of doing this, and said there must be another in the world that could do it. So Gandalf asked Frodo to take it as far as Rivendale. Frodo agreed and was preparing for his trip. His three friends Mery, Perequine, and Sam. Sam was Frodo\u2019s gardener and best friend. He was the son of old Gaffer Gamgee a good friend of Bilbo.  When they started on their journey they heard someone talking to Gaffer asking about Frodo and the ring. On their journey they figured out who the person was. It was a man masked in black riding on a black horse. This figure was trying to take the ring from Frodo. As they traveled through the shire the ran into many friends all offering them help and shelter from these figures. Once they finally reached Rivendale they decided that they would be the ones to carry the ring to Mordor. The Fellowship of the rings was started.The story takes place in a fictional land with magic and fictional creatures like dragons. This is apparent throughout the story because there are elves and hobbits and the Elves no magic. This makes the story slightly more interesting. I think there is to many books on recent events and I enjoy history. Not that this book is history but it certainly isn\u2019t about current events. Frodo was who the story was centered around. He is the hobbit carrying the ring. Frodo was just like Bilbo adventurous, and always curious. He was hesitant about leaving the shire though. Bilbo wasn't always adventurous, when he was young he was invited on a journey and just like Frodo he did not want to accept. Ever since then though he couldn't sit still he was constantly out on adventures and quests. Sam Gamgee was Frodo's best friend. His father Gaffer Gamgee was a good friend of Bilbo's. Sam was Frodo's gardener also. he was quite noisy and he was always into the affairs of Frodo. Gandalf the Grey was the wizard and the provided of such great fireworks. The hobbits only knew him for the fireworks, but Bilbo and Frodo knew him as a wizard and a very smart man. Gandalf was constantly travelling and helping were there was help needed. He didn't like war but he wasn't afraid to fight it. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes fictional books. I would recommend those over 13 though its not that graphic.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "JACOB YOUNG", "stars": "5", "date": "Oct 17, 14", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n            I recently read this book and I loved it so much. I am honestly not one that enjoys to read but this book was hard not to. I really enjoy how this book has fantasy, adventure, and things that are just not real like elves, dwarves, hobbits. That just makes me go to another place and I love it when books broaden my imagination.  This is the first book of a trilogy. The main idea of the first book is that a fellowship (a group of united people) have to go take the ring of doom into the deep mountains of Mordor. Now this ring is terrible and can get a hold of everyone and make anyone crazy for it, even lust it. And the book mostly describes the history of the ring and then it just goes into their journey to Mordor. Of course there are not there yet and have a while to go, but toward the end the fellowship is broken. This happens because the main character, Frodo knows that the others will not make it alive because Sauron, the ruler of the ring, will know that these powerful beings are coming. So he goes alone with Samwise and that's where the book ended. There are a lot of characters in this book so i will be mainly be talking about the ones that really matter. Gandalf the grey is a wizard who is really wise and realized the story of the ring and asked Frodo Baggins to take the ring to Mordor, Frodo is a hobbit, and hobbits tend to be 3 feet tall, but they are really brave creatures. Frodo goes to riven-dale (elf Realm) with his hobbit friends Sam, Merry,and Pippin. Along the way they meet a \"protector\" called Strider but later on realize it is Aragon who is a big deal because he is heir to the person that killed Sauron many years ago. So they all go to Riven-dale and realize they need a team to go to Mordor. So Legolas,Elven Prince of the woodland realm, Gimli, the Dwarf, and boromir the Knight join them Making the \" Fellowship\" of nine members. (Legolas, Boromir, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragon, and Gimli). They are all brave and noble people who would risk their lives in order for this ring to be destroyed. I could honestly write a whole essay on this book because it is that good, So I obviously recommend this book to everyone. I know not everyone will like it though, so I would mostly recommend it someone who loves fantasy and adventure. Anyone who really likes to feel like they are in a different world. I feel also that even if someone that doesn't like science fictional stuff should really read these books because J.R.R Tolkien can really surprise you by how incredibly vivid this book is and how amazing.

{"text": "\n           \n            J.R.R Tolkien, one of the best known fictional authors, did an outstanding job on his first novel of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, The Fellowship Of The Ring. His work was the finest novel of all time. This book is a classic, and this means the book will never get boring after you read it once. Our famous author died at the age of 81(1892-1973). This is a story of a young hobbit, Frodo Baggins, and his companions Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Gimli, Aragorn, Legolas, and Boromir. They are sent on a quest by Elrond to throw the One Ring in the Mount Doom, which they hope will end the war or change the course of the war. Tolkein did a amazing job on showing his setting then telling, because instead of saying it was night time, Tolkein would say that the sun was setting and the moon was rising into the night. The novel did not have as much action as I was hoping for, but Tolkein put in enough to the point where i was satisfied at the end. The Fellowship Of The Ring is a starting point leading to all the action coming up in the next books in the trilogy. I cannot compare this book to another because I have never read anything like it or similar to it.

Lo am\u00e9 de principio a fin. Siento que acabo de conocer al amor de mi vida y que, ya que faltan dos libros de la trilog\u00eda, la amar\u00e9 mientras m\u00e1s sepa de ella. Tantas cosas qu\u00e9 decir, pero lo mantendr\u00e9 simple.Primero, debo decir que en pocos libros hab\u00eda visto una introducci\u00f3n tan extensa y de tantos detalles, pero hasta eso me encant\u00f3. Muy bien elaborada y, como ya le\u00ed  satisfizo muchas de las dudas al leer el primero.Luego est\u00e1 esta historia y este mundo tan elaborado y complejo, tan l\u00f3gico y lleno de una magia tan particular. Una de las cosas m\u00e1s am\u00e9 del libro es que Tolkien explica detalles de Tierra Media hasta el punto en que competan a la historia, eso me encantaba, porque te daba lo ideal de cada cosa, ni tanto que te aburres, ni tan poquito que deseas m\u00e1s y crees el escritor es un ego\u00edsta.Pero, aunque Tolkien cre\u00f3 aqu\u00ed un mundo incre\u00edble, lleno de criaturas misteriosas, aunque cre\u00f3 un lenguaje, aunque me dieron ganas de estar en Rivendell y Lothl\u00f3rien, lo mejor de todo son sus personajes. Todos muy s\u00f3lidos e interesantes. Sin duda, mis favoritos en este mundo son Gandalf y Galadriel. Transmiten algo incre\u00edble los dos.Y, claro, lo que m\u00e1s disfrut\u00e9 es que por fin entiendo cu\u00e1l es la jodienda del Anillo, porque he visto esas pel\u00edculas hasta en marat\u00f3n y como que siempre me quedaba en el aire con ciertos detalles y, las pel\u00edculas son geniales, pero como siempre, esto es el libro. De las muchas diferencias entre una y la otra la que m\u00e1s disfrut\u00e9 es que Frodo tiene m\u00e1s sentido en la vida, es mucho m\u00e1s maduro y consciente de su responsabilidad y su papel en todo esto.Definitivamente, es un libro ideal para aquellos que amamos la fantas\u00eda. Un mundo que no querr\u00e1s abandonar.Y nada, antes de irme les dejo este chistecito que sale a costa de Sam y Frodo (m\u00e1s Sam que Frodo, la verdad).\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Jefther E.", "stars": "5", "date": "Mar 01, 15", "likes": "1"},

{"text": "\n           \n           It is a difficult task to try to give a review to one of the most stunning endeavors taken in modern literature. It is a feat, similar to the one ring of power, that no soul should have to bear. That being said, I shall begin.The Fellowship of the Ring, firstly, is not a full book in itself, nor was it intended to be by the author. The work was rather meant to be a part of a whole, with the whole being the major focus (similar to ancient mythological stories like Homer's Odyssey and Virgil's Aeneid). The publisher's decision to divide the Lord of the Rings novel into three sub-novels has not hurt the quality of the story but it did perhaps misconstrue what the author was intending for it. That being said, the Lord of the Rings in some sense engendered the basics of modern fantasy's structure as we know it (a book series occurring in a world of elves and dwarves and wizards). Tolkien, in short, accomplished the rare feat of bringing the fantastical stories of our ancestors into new light and more significantly into modern media (with the help of Peter Jackson of course). But besides its historical significance, the Fellowship is quite frankly fabulous. Although it could be argued Tolkien was firstly a reader of language, and that his writing was secondary to his main interest in linguistics, Tolkien nonetheless wrote a very impassioned and original story, as evidenced by his creation of the beloved race of hobbits. There are points when the Fellowship digresses in the arch of the story, but it is only to reveal Tolkien's grand creation in the rich world of Middle Earth. The digression is undoubtedly well due by the nature of the text. For Tolkien, the actual creation and meaning of the creation came before the urge to use such creation for a preconceived story. Tolkien himself claims that he gave the fullness of the story little thought before diving right into it. But as most can agree, the fruits of this unorthodox and unintentional method have produced that which orthodoxy and intentionality could likely never touch.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Jecko", "stars": "5", "date": "Jul 28, 15", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           It had been a long, long time since I read the books. It must be something like sixteen or seventeen years... and I'm ashamed to admit I hadn't gone back for a re-read. After finally doing so, I must confess two things: First, the mastery of the craft behind the Fellowship is greater than I realized the first time around, and so much greater than I remembered. Second, I'll be forever grateful to Peter Jackson for giving me a way to revisit Middle Earth as often as I want to (as I've done during the last dozen of years or so) while having fun and having adventures, thus avoiding the heart-wrenching sense of sadness that carries through every single page of the written version. The Fellowship turned out to be a highly emotional experience. There's the sense of hopeless duty of good fighting evil, but there's also the knowledge that, no matter how the fight turns out, the world will change. Frodo sets out in a desperate quest, because there is no one else willing to accept the burden, and Tolkien reminds us of the odds in subtle, delicate ways all the time. He also reminds us that, even if Frodo succeeds, there's a new Age coming and that it will be the age of Men. This knowledge proved to be almost painful, especially in the scenes of Imladris and Lothlorien, and earlier on while Frodo is leaving the shire, because Tolkien sets his elves as epitome of wisdom, harmony, poetry, arts... And all those things, all that magic, is bound to fade even if Good wins against Evil. This time, instead of reading, I listened to the audiobook. The narrator did an excellent job, and it actually helped me realized something. Back in the day, I remember the depth and length of description bothered me a little, the action appeared lacking. However, now I see The Lord of the Rings is all about stoytelling. The narrator is telling us a story, and when writing advice seems to tend toward \"show, don't tell\" and \"kill the narrator and become the character\", this may be jarring. I now believe it is the only way the story could be told, though. The only way it could be so emotional, so moving, is by being told and not just shown.

They are the beacons that show us that the battle is not over and the war is not lost. They are the voices that rally our strength, that cry to us, \"Do not give up!\" They are the banners we look to in the crushing, clashing fray when we are weary and wonder how anyone could ever come out alive.The Fellowship of the Ring is the beginning of a weaving that does just that. The dread and the weakness and the hopelessness that begin in this story are heavy to bear, even before the gravest danger has even been reached. \"[T]here is little hope,\" Gandalf says to Frodo, \"...yet not no hope.\" For there are also moments of quiet wonder and grateful relief and gloried loveliness that the fellowship could hardly appreciate so much if they had not already bled and wept and lost and won.

And it is a reminder that no assault of darkness, and no amount of grief can fully quench the flame of hope that rests inside our hearts.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Kirstie", "stars": "5", "date": "Oct 02, 15", "likes": "1"},

I just don't like Tolkien's never-ending descriptions of places and completely boring dialogues that lead to nowhere. There are chapters and characters' descriptions completely unnecessary for the story to develop, while the main characters themselves receive almost none by comparison. Imagine that you travel somewhere amazing and when you return you spend %90 of the time telling everyone about the airplane food and the road from airport to hotel, and only %10 in telling about the place itself and the things that happened to you there. Yep, I bet waiting in line to pass migrations requires a full-depth description of the place.. NOT. This is probably the only time I have said this in my life: THE MOVIE WAS BETTER. I will be completely disappointed in Tolkien if the sequels share the nature of the first one.

{"text": "\n           \n           The Lord of the Rings is perhaps the greatest novel ever written. Not only does it have everything a reader could ask for (great characters, imagery, plot, and lore), it single-handedly made the fantasy genre a lot more popular.The book is split into three volumes: , , and .  begins with Bilbo Baggins as he gives his nephew Frodo Baggins his inheritance. Within the inheritance is a gold ring that is revealed to be the One Ring, the conduit for antagonist Sauron\u2019s ultimate dominion. Frodo must then embark on a quest with a fellowship to destroy the One Ring. One of the many aspects the book is praised (and sometimes criticized) for is the massive amounts of imagery. Every page is filled with vivid descriptions of the environment that ultimately makes you feel as if you were in Middle-Earth. Ranging from the trees in a nearby forest to the intricate details of the clothes the characters are wearing, everything is described in a way that is easily visualized. However, this can detract from the main adventure as sometimes the book focuses too much on petty details. Just seeing how one person could create an entire world from scratch is really impressive.Because the Fellowship of the Ring is only a third of The Lord of the Rings, the plot takes a while to get going although this isn\u2019t a bad thing; in fact it actually suits the magnitude of the book. It answers questions from the previous book, gets you acquainted with the setting and characters, and fills you in on the massive lore of the races, lands, and history of Middle-Earth. The pacing of the plot pretty good too, as it does not rush into the \u201cgood stuff\u201d but also does not drag on. It also gives each of the characters time to develop and show who they really are. As the story progress, we meet a vast assortment of characters that play their roles in the journey. From loyal friend Sam Gamgee to the wise wizard Gandalf, each character has a unique presence that is wonderful to see how they grow over time. What\u2019s interesting to note is that within the fellowship, there is one of each race of Middle-Earth (hobbits, elves, dwarves, etc.). This is especially great as we get to witness the interactions among each representative as well as see the defining traits and personalities of each race. If I had to rate this book, it would  be a 10/10. The amount of lore and history of Middle-Earth is just breath-taking. Words alone cannot describe how much I love this book and series. This is one of those books where you really need to read to understand just how great it is. I highly recommend anyone who hasn\u2019t read the book to give it a try. Who knows, it might even become one of your favorite books!\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "404 Not Found", "stars": "5", "date": "Jan 20, 15", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was an amazing experience. I have read few books that I would consider to be counted as an experience. Tolkien wrote the Lord of the Rings like a history book for Middle-Earth, which was very interesting to see how much the world played into the story and vice versa. All the characters are charming and memorable;such as the protagonist, Frodo Baggins. I also liked how many of the characters interacted too with the dozen of different races. However, my one complaint of this first book is the painstakingly slow beginning. The book takes 250 pages or so to get into when the story really starts getting suspenseful. Don't get me wrong, those 250 pages are very good but not nearly as good as the rest of the book.

My paternal Grandmother and Tolkien were friends. My father met him first when he was seven , asking the great man about \u201crunes\u201d. Tolkien duly explained in detail what the letters were and gave him a signed copy of The Hobbit. Of course when you have a friend like this in the family it is sung from the roof tops and then years later \"dropped\" into a review on good reads. I can only imagine how Tolkien would view all this and the films etc. Anyway, we better get on with the review part or else this will be pulled down and I will have to convert it into a blog. My father, a writer and musician also, has a love of this book that may even exceed my own and read me the entire trilogy (voicing each character in the most enthralling way) when i was seven years old. The effect it had on me was titanic. Tolkien creates a world so vivid, complex and dynamic it left me reeling. It still does. I read it at least every three years. As soon as my reading was up to scratch I tackled it myself. The voices in my head still the ones my dad had voiced. It was another level of wonderful. To surmise, this book should be read before all others in my opinion. Despite being fantastical and other worldly its humanity shines from every page, the characters whole and visceral. The adventure and narrative, dialogue and depth are such that you are bereft when it climaxes and ends.

The first half of the book is fascinating but slower than molasses until you get to the scene on Weathertop. The second part moves quite a bit faster and is much easier to read. I do wish that some of the songs/ballads were not included. They tend to throw me out of the story so I briefly skim them. I do love the characters even in the slow parts of this book. Samwise Gamghee and Aragorn still reign supreme as my favorites. Sam is the ultimate wingman for Frodo and he takes care of everything he can for him. And despite the slow first half, I still love this book and hope that it's not another 8 years before I reread it.

I will continue reading the Fellowship until I'm an old man but still not know everything about the history and culture of middle earth. Also J.R.R Tolkien makes very good and intriguing characters.

{"text": "\n           \n           By and large I was a latecomer to Tolkien's world in The Lord of the Rings. I think I read the Two Towers first because the local library (wonderful although libraries ARE -support your local library-) only had that one of the trilogy in stock. Speaking of 'trilogy' I know it's a misnomer, but it's one that seems to have taken off even among the most devoted LOTR fans. LOTR was actually written in six books, but often sold in three volumes, so people often call it a trilogy. That, and the magnificent work of Peter Jackson in adapting the books into a groundbreaking film trilogy, played no small part in this renaming. But I'm getting off the point, I will hopefully talk about book to movie adaptations in my review of The Two Towers. So I was a latecomer to the series. I remember we had this beautiful edition of all the books unabridged with these gorgeous illustrations by Alan Lee at home, and I would pour over the illustrations making up my own half-formed story and promising myself that  I would be old enough and clever enough to read and handle the book with delicate bible-thin paper. Eventually I read the Two Towers and decided I didn't think much of it.BUT NOW, NOW EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED.I've come back to these books after a long break. I controversially read The Hobbit first, and then moved on to the 'trilogy' and what I really want to talk about here, in my review about the first part of the series is the importance of  . It's tempting to think that Tolkien basically began this trope, the quest combined with the magical object, because we've been conditioned in recent literary history (not without reason) to see Tolkien as the spring from which all fantasy rivers flow. Of course, magical objects existed for millenia (millennia?) before Tolkien. Ancient traditions often had magical armour, shields, or weapons as their magical objects: Excalibur, Ajax's shield, Poseidon's trident..you get the idea. Magical items of clothing or jewellery are also common in ancient traditions (PS I know I'm saying 'ancient traditions' and then only talking about Celtic, Roman, Arthurian, and Greek tradition, but they're all I know and I really don't want to screw up talking about ancient Hindu magical objects) such as Aphrodite's girdle. AND THERE ARE EVEN MAGIC RINGS- well, there's one (haha) magic ring in particular from Greek mythology that is interesting to us with regard to this book and that is Gyges, a mythical magical artifact that granted its owner the power to become invisible at will. Sound familiar?Anyway, the point I'm making is that magical objects are for some reason really, really important to humans for storytelling. But what Tolkien has done, which is most interesting to me, is that he has chosen a plain, golden ring to be the MOST IMPORTANT MAGICAL OBJECT, not a sword, not armour, but a plain golden ring. And I think this ties very well with the fact that the ring-bearer is a hobbit, the least-assuming, and the least grand of the races of Middle-Earth. Somehow Tolkien taps into a pre and long existing narrative trope of the magical object but shrinks it right down so that it can fit on a hobbit. And I wonder if in that somewhere, lies the longstanding appeal of the Lord of the Rings. Such a small thing, and such a small person, rules the fate of so many.Of course, the trope of the magical object blossomed after Tolkien. CS Lewis has Susan's horn and Lucy's phial, JK Rowling has the philosopher's stone and the deathly hallows, Pullman has the (googles spelling quickly) alethiometer. But none of these really are common every day objects that someone in our 21st century world can imagine carrying as they are all magical and/or not of our time in and of themselves. I feel like the One Ring really did break the mould in this respect.I'm also interested in the laws of magical objects and how they work on the people who possess them, or whom they possess as the case may be. Any action done with the One Ring, we are told, no matter what the intention, will always be evil. I suppose in this respect it is kind of like the Elder Wand, although Dumbledore had it for ages and you can't really say he was evil, but something bad always happens to whoever owns the Elder Wand. It is strangely cut and dry then, the ring is evil, but people are still tempted by its power. It tempts the wise, the strong, and the good, and this I think makes it a very compelling magical object in itself.This was a great read, and I particularly liked the songs. I know Tolkien said numerous times that the books were  but I am interested to match and compare WWI marching/travelling songs/poems as well as poems about home or fallen comrades with those in this book to see what the match-up is like. Whether the series is about the war or not, it was such a huge event that no one, least of all Tolkien, could honestly say they were untouched or uninfluenced by it.That's all for now, as usual, love to hear what you think about magical objects/the book/etc.Booklove,Grace\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Grace Mc Gowan", "stars": "5", "date": "Oct 26, 15", "likes": "1"},

I really liked Legolas\u2019s song as well.

The only tiny flaw is that sometimes the plot can be dragged out by so much information. As we got out of the Shire, this hardly bothered me at all.

Upon starting Fellowship, I realized what a task I was undertaking. I clearly remember when the feeling of boredom hit me: it was right when the hobbits were lost in the old forest for days. Days upon days of description of the landscape and the weather and even the slightest feelings that the Hobbits had. Now don't get me wrong, I didn't loathe the book like some do. I also don't think that Tolkien's writing is horrible like some make it out to be, it's just that at certain parts there is too much exposition. I did enjoy the way that Tolkien described things, he's able to weave beautiful prose together fluidly, it's just that at some points it was too much. What I do enjoy is a more thorough understanding of the characters, plot, and mythology that only the books can give. The world itself is wonderful and it's amazingly detailed, I just didn't care much for the extra songs and the description of every bush along the journey. It's worth noting that part of the reason that audiences find LOTR boring nowadays is that modern writing is suited toward our low attention spans. In reading older books like Jane Eyre, you can see the same exposition-oriented writing that you do in LOTR.

{"text": "\n           \n           Tolkien\u2019s influence in the fantasy genre is a sight to truly behold. So, as a lover of fantasy, I decided it would be worthwhile to delve in to Middle-Earth with Frodo and Company and see where it all began. I haven\u2019t seen the movies so my review of  and the two other books will be free of movie bias. The ring that Bilbo Baggins found in  makes a return in . It is up to his heir, Frodo Baggins, to bring the ring to Modor where it may be destroyed forever. The ring is dangerous, especially in the hands of the one who seeks it, Sauron. The plot isn\u2019t something I\u2019d call very exciting. It\u2019s really not. Destroy the ring by bringing it to the fires of Mordor. Simple enough plot. There are trial and tribulations along the way but the story is really simple. That doesn\u2019t make it bad, mind you. There isn\u2019t anything else I can really say about the plot because the majority of the book was descriptions and Tolkien dragging his feet.Heavy is a word I\u2019d use to describe the writing. Heavy, but unnecessarily so. I feel like this book could have been half its size and just as good. The thing about Tolkien\u2019s writing is that I can appreciate it but I do  like it. It\u2019s heavy and dull and drags on and on for no good reason. I spent nearly two weeks on  when I should have finished in within a week easily, all because of the writing. This book was about ninety percent description. And even then, it wasn\u2019t good. More description is supposed to add to the story but it did not in this book. Tolkien had a bad habit of over explaining and describing landscapes and such without actually giving the reader a clear picture of it. I could not for the life of me picture anything he described because he didn\u2019t do it very well. It was also irritating how we pretty much got no descriptions of the characters.I will give it up to Tolkien that when he wants to pick up the pace, he\u2019s a good writer. Unfortunately it took him three-fourths of the book to think \u201cGee, maybe I should speed things up a bit\u201d.I didn\u2019t care about the characters at all. Since most of the book was spent talking about the journey to Mordor, descriptions of nature, or Middle-Earth\u2019s confusing history, very little time was spent on the characters. I couldn\u2019t even connect with Frodo, our protagonist. He had no personality to speak of. I have no doubt that Tolkien gave him a wonderful personality in his own head, but he certainly didn\u2019t put it down on paper. The only character I liked was Sam Gamgee. He was an adorable little hobbit who\u2019s fiercely protective of Frodo and loyal to boot. Sam\u2019s a sweet character and he\u2019s the only one that has any semblance of a personality. Everybody else was just\u2026there.The pacing, descriptions, and history of Middle-Earth were three things I really didn\u2019t like. I actually didn\u2019t like a lot, but these are things that I especially didn\u2019t enjoy. The pacing was very, very slow. I didn\u2019t like it one bit. I was nearly a fourth of a way through the book before Frodo even made it out of the Shire! That\u2019s not a good start to a fantasy-adventure book. Nearly the entire novel crawled at a snail\u2019s pace. It only picked up in the last fourth of the novel.The descriptions of things were terrible. I couldn\u2019t imagine anything for the life of me. I haven\u2019t seen the movies so all of these locations and details were completely lost on me. Tolkien is not very good at helping form an image in his readers\u2019 minds (at least not mine). I had to actually look up images from the movie to try to understand what Tolkien was saying.The history of Middle-Earth that is dumped on the reader was such a pain to read. It was like being dropped in the middle of an ancient Chinese history class and being expected to know what everybody\u2019s talking about. People are always talking about Tolkien\u2019s world building but I didn\u2019t see any of it in . He created a complex world, yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean he built it well.Middle-Earth is very white. Some people are described as having brown skin but none of our main characters. There is one female character I can name, Galadriel, and she\u2019s  neat? She doesn\u2019t have all that much time in the book and doesn\u2019t actually do much. As far as diversity goes, it\u2019s obvious that Tolkien\u2019s creativity stops here. I\u2019m sad but not surprised to say that I didn\u2019t like . I didn\u2019t like  so it\u2019s no wonder I didn\u2019t like this book either. I liked the fact that the hero wasn\u2019t someone who was especially strong or smart or cunning. He was an ordinary little hobbit who was tasked to go on an extraordinary quest. I\u2019m willing to stick out the other two books just because I want to see where a lot of present fantasy novels get their influence from. Tolkien\u2019s influence is in a lot of places and if I didn\u2019t read his works then some things would be lost to me in those other books. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring", "user": "Whitney", "stars": "2", "date": "Jun 07, 15", "likes": "1"},

It was so beautiful, and you knew what you were reading and where you were at in the book. It did get wordy at times, but that was like one time out of the whole book. It took me a month to finish it, but it was worth it. I'm very happy I got to read this and in a month or two, after a small break, I'll start the second book. I have the three book bind up version of this, but it's huge! :) So, I wouldn't recommend this to people wanting to start reading fantasy. It is a heavy read, but for people who already know fantasy and want to find a good book, this is it.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Alyssandra", "stars": "5", "date": "Aug 23, 15", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           I returned to The Lord of the Rings after first reading it voraciously in college many years ago. It was interesting to read this first part with the knowledge and experience I now have, including the study of Old Norse and Old English texts and Early Medieval art history, which provided some of Tolkien\u2019s sources. Though I am no longer twenty, it\u2019s still a great read! I am struck by the sense of humor that crops up here and there, especially when it comes to the hobbits, who have a predilection for drinking songs and dancing on tables. The humor leavens the sense of sadness, loss, and nostalgia for a past golden age, when beings like elves lived in harmony with nature and each other. Tolkien\u2019s reverent descriptions of landscape, woods, waterways, and the night sky also relieve the tension of being tracked by maleficent creatures such as orcs, ringwraiths and balrogs. Were the author alive today, I believe he would be an ardent advocate for natural preservation and sustainability. In early medieval mode, he is also a big advocate for loyalty and commitment to one\u2019s \u201cfellowship,\u201d no matter how different they are. And they are indeed different: several hobbits, a wizard, an elf, a dwarf, and two men. I think Tolkien would fit right in with today\u2019s multicultural world. Finally, Tolkien\u2019s work is surprisingly psychological, addressing the battles within and the difficulty of self-control: the greed for power over others, represented by the One Ring--versus the dedication to peace and respect, not only toward other beings and creatures, but toward the earth itself. Tolkien still speaks in a clear voice to our contemporary world. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Lori Eshleman", "stars": "5", "date": "Jun 28, 15", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           How did I go so long without re-reading this? For years I re-read this trilogy on average once a year, I got out of the habit as time and an abundance of books to read pressed in on me.First I'll say I do understand the people who \"can't get into it\". We live in a world overflowing with fantasy and fiction novels, with strong female characters (So very absent in this trilogy) and easily accessible novels that can be read, like literary candy-floss, with no effort or effect...This story is written from a world that is no more; it is practically a historical novel, like Austin or Wilde, breathtakingly new and vibrant yet lasting the test of time for some of us. Because it was written so long ago, the historical issue is that in the writing it often challenges younger people to consider different mores of behaviour. For example, I have so often heard Sam and Frodo's relationship described as homoerotic that I have given up pointing out that behavioural mores change over time, but they do, they really do a lot.This book is gorgeous; it describes golden peacefulness and dark torment with equal creativity, it takes you on a journey into the deepest fantasy of the psyche in a way that so very few novels can. I am once again captured by the joy of reading, that I first experienced at thirteen, when I first read The Fellowship through. Again I'm full of gratitude that this amazing saga was written and that I got to read it. Again, I cant wait before embarking on \"The two towers\" ...Incidentally, my copy is the 1959 one, but it is not on Goodreads so I faked it :)\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Deborah Ideiosepius", "stars": "5", "date": "Aug 30, 15", "likes": "1"},

{"text": "\n           \n           I love the basic story of the Lord of the Rings and the Fellowship of the Ring would be an awesome start for Frodos adventure if there wouldn\u2019t be so many distractions and unnecessary descriptions. I think if you are a fan of Tolkiens works and/or re-read the book those details are an amazing thing that make you love the books/universe even more, but for first time readers without much additional knowledge about Tolkiens world it can get out of hand and make the reading experience really hard. I nearly fell asleep more than once while reading it and in the end I stopped re-reading sentences when I realized I got distracted somewhere along the paragraphs 5 times in a row. I just continued in hope it wouldn\u2019t be important (and if it was I would just come back to it later on and re-read it then). All the background information we get on the history of all the different people, towns, countries etc. is a wonderful thing if you are familiar with the books and/or series, but if you don\u2019t know much about them it can be a bit confusing. I sometimes found myself struggling with all the elbish names and stories and reached a point were I was so confused about who is who that I decided to just memorize the important ones and ignore background stories that seemed unimportant to the main plot.Don\u2019t get me wrong! I love the world Tolkien created! I love the characters! I honestly do, but as of now I find myself loving Bilbo more than Frodo. It\u2019s probably due to the Hobbit being only one book and Frodo\u2019s adventure being three books long. Obviously Frodo doesn\u2019t make as much progress in the character development departement (while still remaining himself) as Bilbo did. What I really enjoy are the different kinds of relationships between the characters. It gives the whole book a special feeling as normally you\u2019d have very straight forward, kind of standard relationships. In the Lord of the Rings most relationships grow subtily. You won\u2019t notice them at first, but all of a sudden you\u2019ll realize that they are there and this gave me a special feeling I hardly feel with other books. I also enjoyed the relationships that already existed.Overall I really enjoyed the Fellowship of the Ring. It\u2019s only flaw being the pace. I\u2019m still hyped to read the other two books and learn more about the \u201ctrue\u201d journey of Frodo and his companions as it is quiet different from the movies.\n         ", "book": "Der Herr der Ringe -  Die Gef\u00e4hrten", "user": "Alessandra", "stars": "4", "date": "Apr 13, 15", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           Perhaps you've made this mistake: a movie is announced for a book you've been intending to read (and in this case, for a long time...). So you shrug and say \"not until I read the book.\" Now, bear in mind, you are the only person who is not going to the movie, and after a while you become exhausted with people ruining the plot for you. So you cave in and go see the movie, enjoy it, and are left with an overall feeling of dissatisfaction--like eating McDonalds when you meant to get something half-way decent at Subway.Eventually you get the gumption to lose weight, er, read the book, and lo and behold, you have the following problem: you are unable to \"see\" the characters as the author intended. Forget the descriptors, you've already had the characters, backdrops, and props cast by the movie. This unfortunately was the case for me with LOTR: Fellowship.Now, to address the novel, as nonpartisan as I can.Fellowship of the Ring has an unenviable task: J.R.R. Tolkien was more than blazing a path...he was exploring an entirely new area. In his philological decision to create language(s), all of Middle Earth as we and Peter Jackson know it came from this man. Although the Simarillion was purportedly the first true novel which Tolkien continually updated throughout his life, Fellowship had a dual role: first, to populate Middle Earth...as in ALL of Middle Earth (and not just a few choice places, ala the Hobbit), and secondly, the responsibility to finish off loose ends from the Hobbit and explain things in a way which left readers satisfied with the outcome.No small task.Yet, Tolkien performed it admirably. Fellowship is an entirely enjoyable book, one which does not require the reader to have read the Hobbit to enjoy. For anyone who has ever suffered picking up a book far later in a series only to encounter a paragraph which reads \"but of course CHARACTER X knew this, because CHARACTER X had clearly been/done/see/known this because CHARACTER X was there when...\" so on and so forth. Stylistically cheap, if not effective.Tolkien, however, does not employ this. Rather, the reader is invited to a travelogue (a long one...) of a place far away and fantastic, or \"long ago\" depending on the persuasion of your imagination. Either way, the beauty and horror of Middle Earth is unfolded with Ansel Adams-like grace. This if anything is perhaps the only shortcoming of the book; in the authorized paperback edition of the novel which I read, actual action and or brisk pace does not begin until the last 80 or so pages of the book.Now for you movie goers who ask themselves \"what did I miss that's worth 458 pages?\"1) A brief look at Frodo's childhood trauma with Farmer Maggot and an extended flight from the Ring Wraiths.2) an entire whimsical sequence with an largely mysterious character named Tom Bombadil and his (lover?) Goldberry. 3)An awesome sequence with barrow wights and Frodo actually possessing enough courage to fight an enemy. 4)A MUCH extended Council of Elrond. 5)A savage fight with some spectral wolves.6) A few short tales of the past from Aragorn. 7)A MERCIFULLY shorter Lothlorien sequence than the film. 8)A lot of songs...I mean a LOT. As in, Disney musical. Every character recites ballads, songs, and the like.9)And the following piece of dialogue, as attributed to all four of the hobbits. \"Oh, I wish I were back in the shire\" and \"what a queer fellow/place/feeling\". Seriously, the word is employed nearly twice a page.So, that's the novels additions. I have begun the Two Towers and already I am impressed at the pace with which it moves. Whether or not Tolkien could/should have shortened the book is entirely reader perception. His beloved place of fantasy is ours, and the prose is oftentimes beautiful. I wish I had read the novel before seeing the films, but that's that. Now, unlike most times this happens, I will be stuck with Peter Jackson's Middle Earth for the next two novels. Same thing with the Hobbit with which I am nearly finished as well (in comparison, LOTR is written far more powerfully). J.R.R. Tolkien was a true pioneer, with whom we owe an entire genre, Dungeons and Dragons, and countless other forms of entertainment to.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Mark Hennion", "stars": "4", "date": "Feb 06, 15", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           Before winter break began, I read The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien. Having enjoyed that book, I immediately began reading The Fellowship of The Ring, which dives even deeper in the crazy, magical, and imaginative world that Tolkien created in his classic The Hobbit. This book caused me to spend many hours lost in the world of our favorite Hobbits, along with Gandalf and of course the evil Sauron.One thing that Tolkien does extremely well is using a mythical, prophetical, and magical set of language to enchant his writing. His poetic abilities shown in chapter ten are simply fantastic, specifically the first two lines of a poem about Aragorn, who saves Frodo, the protagonist's life several times:All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost (Chapter 10)I love the way Tolkien incorporated this beautiful sentence into a beautiful poem, into a beautiful story! The common phrase: \u201cAll that is gold does not glitter\u201d sets the tone in a way for a mystical poem featuring Aragorn, who is not known very well at the time the poem is revealed, so there is an element of mystery added. This one of many examples brilliant J.R.R. Tolkien writing.Normally in my dialogue essays, I stick to one central quote. However that is very hard to do when studying a complex story such as The Fellowship of The Ring. Similar to many quest-based stories, Tolkien's trilogy opener has the common motif of \u201cThe road\u201d. This also is shown in The Hobbit, when Bilbo sets off on his quest.\u201c[Bilbo] used to say there was only one Road; that it was like a great river: its springs were at every doorstep, and every path was its tributary (Chapter 3).\tThis is quite a powerful metaphor comparing the road being travelled to a river, taking the travellers with it\u2019s current. It also describes the connection between every place in Middle-Earth. \tAll in all, Tolkien did an amazing job with this classic story, along with the entire trilogy. This is not a set of books to be forgotten, and that is why I\u2019ve decided that out of 5 stars, I give this book a 5!\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Jack Adams", "stars": "5", "date": "Jan 14, 15", "likes": "1"},

It is a well-written and compelling story. The trilogy as a whole is one of the most comprehensive examples of Joseph Campbell's \"mono-myth\" I am aware of. Furthermore, Tolkien's place in the world of fiction cannot be overstated. He practically invented the sub-genre of high fantasy and his attention to detail in the crafting of fictional worlds set the bar for all fantasy and science fiction since, from Gene Roddenberry to George RR Martin. That's not to say his writing is perfect. Much of the dialog is clunky and I found myself skimming over the poetry/songs regularly. Despite some shortcomings, I highly recommend this book, even to those who may not like it. It's pervasive presence in pop culture has held for more than half a century.

{"text": "\n           \n            The book, \"The Lord of The Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring\" was by far one of the most entertaining and action filled books I have read. In this book a man named Frodo lives in the Shire and he lives a simple life. It is when a wise wizard comes along and tells Frodo he had a ring with much power. This ring is capable of terrible destruction. Frodo, led by his courage, bravery, and cleverness is faced with the challenge of taking it to the evil land Mordor and casting it into the volcano. It is a hands down 5 star book. I think the theme of this story is how bravery can send people on big quests because Frodo is given the Ring of power, which is a ring made by the dark lord Sauron and it is a evil as him. Frodo is brave enough to do what the wise wizard Gandalf wants him to do. Frodo and his partner Sam are described in a very nice fashion. Frodo is the nephew of the Hobbit Biblo and he leads a very simple life. He has a best friend named Sam and he is a Hobbit as well. Sam is rather chubby but he has a lot of courage. This book is written in 3rd person and takes place in Middle Earth, a place similar to earth with a few non-real characteristics. It is written in paragraphs and the narrator is omniscient. I would recommend this book to anybody 7th grade and up. It has a very nice variety of vocabulary and involves a lot of killing. So only people that can handle death should read this book. One time where there is mystery is when Bilbo disappears in the middle of his birthday speech and leaves. One instance of entertainment is when Gandalf is shooting fireworks into the skies. This book is like my life in the sort that once I could choose to get shots for an illness that I had all at once or spread out at different times. I did what Frodo did and I was brave to get all of those pesky shots all at once. I felt like this book describes a place a lot before actually getting to anything that happens in the book. I think in the next book they will continue on their quest.

{"text": "\n           \n           I wasn't enjoying it very much for a lot of the book; it was rather slow-paced--it took Frodo  to get up off his butt and start the quest, and he'd hardly even left the Shire when I was 1/4 through. The most exciting parts were (frequently, but not always!) the parts that Peter Jackson'd kept for the film. And then those elves...they talked and they talked and they delayed the quest and they talked and they sang... (Speaking of singing, Tom Bombadil's songs got very stickily stuck in my noggin.)I don't call the slower pacing/long descriptions a flaw, at least not in this case, but it wasn't exactly my favorite thing. But! I was very interested to learn about the lore and such that did not show up in the movie, and the little facts about Aragorn, Sam, Gimli, etc. that would have complicated the films too much. Tolkien is one of the best world-builders out there, if not  best (he's gotta be the best, amiright [ooooh, but Orwell]), and I got to really feel the distances and the time-passing and whatnot in this. (I didn't get that from the film so much, because I'm a visual learner and everything in my head is images, and like movie clips, there is nothing to fill in the gaps between those images. Therefore I can't wrap my mind around the vastness.) I liked seeing the different sides of Merry and Pippin. In the movies they are mainly shown to be fun-loving pranksters (s'way I remember 'em, anyhow), but in  you get to see that Merry's a planner, and inquisitive, while Pippin's quite the kid. Sam, too, I learnt more about. He's got a very good sense for things, and a few times surprises the others with his creative prowess.

{"text": "\n           \n           The Fellowship of the Ring is great book filled with adventure and fantasy. This book tells the story of the main dynamic character Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee, his faithful his friend and servant, journey to Mordor to destroy the One Ring of Sauron. Tolkien used his amazing imagery to create this incredible fantasy realm of The Middle-Earth. The One Ring if not destroyed will destroy anything that is good in Middle-Earth. Tolkien proves that no matter how pure or good a person can be the influence of power can influence them and corrupt them. Middle-Earth's beauty can all be destroyed by this One Ring falling into the wrong hand and not being destroyed.The ring symbolizes an endless power that no boundaries and is so appealing to a person or in the books case the different races and will ruin everything. Tolkien is a great creator of these many different races of characters the two main characters are Hobbits my personal favorite is the Elves for their sense of purity and light. The Lady Galadriel an elf is depicted as the face of beauty. Tolkien used her to show just how powerful that just the idea of being in possession of the One Ring would completely ruin her and turn her into a great evil. Power is an all controlling idea anyone desires. Tolkien is very blunt about the powers of this ring. The ring has the words \" One Ring to rule them all, One ring to find them, One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them\" engraved on the ring in the Elvish language of Mordor. It couldn't be more prominent then that. The only way to destroy the ring and its power is to throw it in the very place it was created, the Fire Mountain in Mordor. Tolkien creates such powerful images allowing to feel like your apart of this adventure and see just what this type of power can do to someone. The only way to remove evil is to remove it from the source in which it was created. The movie version of this book directed by Peter Jackson is in my opinion a great representation of the book. The movie stays relatively close to the book, with some changes. The changes that were made like, the breaking of Isildur father's sword does not affect the overall plot of the story. The movie does the book justice in bringing Tolkien's beautiful Middle-Earth to life in an astonishing way. The Fellowship of the Ring is an amazing beginning to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien's use of imagery is what makes this book so captivating and living on for generation after generation to read. Power is something that will always be prominent in our everyday lives and some can with hold it while others it corrupts and destroys, but a power with no boundaries has no limits to who it can corrupt. Overall this was an amazing book, that transports you to a whole other world filled with fantasy and adventure.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Helena Muse", "stars": "5", "date": "Dec 11, 14", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           The Fellowship of the Ring is a master piece written by J.R.R Tolkien. Certainly one of the greatest creations in literature I have ever read. The story begins with re-telling of how the great rings of power came to be. 3 rings were given to the Elves, the wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven were given to the Dwarfs, great miners and craftsman. Nine rings were given to the men, who above all else desire power. The book then speaks of a master ring that was forged in secret by the dark lord Sauron, in an attempt to take control of all the other rings of power. TH=is ring is a tangible embodiment of evil. After a great battle ensues between the forces of Sauron and the Forces of Elves and Men, Sauron is defeated and the ring falls into the hands of the son of the king, Isildur, who refused to destroy it due to his own humanity. After some time of carrying the ring, the ring \"betrayed\" Isildur and *SPOILER* caused him to be slain by a surprise ambush of orcs. The ring then slipped into the river Anduin. For two and a half thousand years, the ring slipped out of all knowledge. Until one day, it stumbled into the hands of a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. Later, in the year 1400, on the 22nd day of september is where the adventure begins. The ring is discovered to be held by Bilbo Baggins by the wise old wizard, Gandalf. Bilbo then leaves the shire in hopes to escape the effects of carrying the ring for so long, and leaves all of his possessions to Frodo, his nephew. Gandalf speaks of the evils of the ring to Frodo and explains how it must be destroyed or Frodo will be killed. He orders Frodo to journey to the village of Bree where he would ideally meet with Gandalf accompanied by friends Sam, Pippin, and Merry, but unfortunately, Gandalf was taken prisoner by his now twisted mentor, Saruman. At Bree, the company does not meet Gandalf but they do meet a ranger of the north named Aragorn. After evading certain doom that the ring has drawn to them, Aragorn decides to take them to Rivendell, the home of the elves. Frodo is gravely injured on the way to Rivendell, but is rescues by the Elves. After a council in Rivendell, a fellowship of nine members is established on the journey to the dark land of Mordor to destroy the ring. Along the way *SPOILER* two members of the fellowship are lost, Gandalf and Borromir. At the end of the book, the fellowship breaks apart as Frodo learns he must travel to the Mordor alone, however, not without the company of Sam.Character Development: There is not much room of character development seeing as this is the first book in a massive trilogy. But two characters stand out in terms of development. Those characters are Aragorn and Sam. Aragorn is the one true heir to the greatest kingdom on Middle Earth, Minas Tirith. Though he refuses to accept his destiny and chooses the life of a ranger. It is in this novel where Aragorn starts to understand the person the world needs him to be. The other person who I believe grows the most in the story is Sam. Sam is a servant to Frodo Baggins as he tends to his gardens. He is commanded by Gandalf to accompany Frodo on the journey and to keep him safe. The impressive thing is that in this story, Sam is amongst the most courageous of the entire fellowship. Sam is a hobbit like Frodo, hobbits are not creatures bred for war, but for peace and love. You come to learn that carrying comes with a very steep price, and you learn that the weaker Frodo becomes, the stronger Sam needs to be, it is really something to see a creature act in such valor when he is not a creature of it.Recommendation: I think this book is one of the greatest creations in literature and I highly recommend it to anybody and everybody. The book will certainly pertain to a specific audience more than others, but if you are looking for a tale of courage, love, and friendship, The Fellowship of the Ring is a book for you. Even if fantasy literature is not something for you, I believe that there is something for everybody in this story. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Zach Haveraneck", "stars": "5", "date": "Dec 01, 14", "likes": "1"},

De resto puedo decir que es una maravilla. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Rhaella", "stars": "4", "date": "Jan 09, 15", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           As a person who watched the movies before reading the book I was blown away. I never knew how different the two were just because of all the stuff that they took out of a the book. There were points in this book that made it take longer. There where other parts that had me screaming \u201cwhy did they change it so much?\" Take for example the meeting of farmer Maggot and Frodo, where the reader learns back story and lead to fear this man, but then relieved to find out he is actually a nice guy, as in the movie we don't even see farmer maggot other than only Frodo and the others running from him. Like I had said before I have not watched the movie so nothing really surprised me. Other than the part when the fellowship enter the realm of the wood elves that scene was very impressive and awesome sounding.The plot of the book is interesting to me how an immense weapon like \u201cThe Ring\u201d would end up in the hands of the most unlikely of people as the Bagginses. The plot is the story of Frodo Baggins who come in position of an ancient and powerful ring. This ring is evil and contains the last chance of an evil entity known as Soron to re-enter the world. In order to destroy the ring a fellowship of all the main races of middle-earth is made to accomplish this task. This part is the first part in three to tell of their travels.  The characters are hard not to fall in love with. Frodo Baggins is the bearer of the ring but man he is an awesome hobbit. The amount of courage he shows in volunteering the carry the ring. He is so innocent and show this naivety towards the world, but some how has an uncanny wisdom about him. I guess that's what you get for growing up in the Shire. Frodo is just one character in this book there are many other to talk about like Sam, Pippin, Gandalf, and Strider and the others of the fellowship.The setting of the book takes place in knights and castle realm called middle-earth. As you can guess it takes place in a time line much like out middle ages, but much more cooler in my opinion.I loved this book and I think many other people world like this book as well. If you don't like stories of fantasy this book may not be for you. If you like a good story of adventure and good sword fights you will love this book. It is hard not to immerse yourself in this world.If you are into that you will love this book. I recommend this book to everyone because the fact it is a classic.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Nic", "stars": "5", "date": "Jan 06, 15", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           The first time I read this book, I read an old copy of the book published in the 1960s, and according to the numerous forewords in this book, the version that I just finished is markedly different from the one I originally read. I exaggerate a bit (most of the changes are typos, corrections from \"corrected\" spellings, or other changes made by the publishers from the original manuscript, which means these are changes that I didn't expect to notice), but the way the authors talk about the changes, one would expect this to be like, say, reading the 1990 version of The Stand against the 1978 version. There was a lot of talk of tedious page-by-page comparisons between the US edition and the UK edition, using optical readers to make word-by-word comparisons, meetings with Christopher Tolkien to better understand the author's intent, etc. There has been (apparently) a lot of work put into making sure the 50th anniversary edition of the book was as close to the original manuscript as possible.What I found most intriguing about the forewords was that it touched on the creative process that Tolkien had for creating this story. Apparently his first drafts were written in pencil, and his second drafts were (unless I was misunderstanding this part) written in ink over those pencil drafts, with some words changing between drafts. It made draft comparisons fairly tricky, not just because of Tolkien's style of writing drafts, but also because the pencil had smudged after nearly seventy years, making some of the original writing illegible. So not only were the restorationists working to recreate the original story, but they were working really hard to do so.Tolkien also used the margins of his handwritten manuscripts to think through plot development, characters, or whatever else was relevant to the story at a given time. This was what precipitated the meetings with Christopher Tolkien, I suppose because the manuscripts are still held by the family. There's a multi-volume set of Lord of the Rings that includes annotations and other supplemental material gained from these notes, and I'll admit, part of me would like to see those. It just seems like a lot of Middle-earth, possibly more than could maintain my interest.So, why am I spending so much time talking about the forewords instead of the book itself? Because there's really no point in reviewing The Fellowship of the Ring, is there? There's nothing I can add to the commentary that hasn't been covered in the last seventy years. The only thing I can saw is that if you saw the movies, but never read the books themselves, you really should read them. I'm re-reading this volume, and The Two Towers, so I can finally get around to reading The Return of the King. I know, I know; I should have read it a long time ago.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Thomas", "stars": "5", "date": "Dec 21, 14", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           The Fellowship of The Ring Is one of my favorite books. This book is written by one of my favorite authors, J.R.R. Tolkien. The plot starts out with Bilbo, the ancient man who stole the ring in The Hobbit. The ring is eventually passed down to the young Frodo. Frodo is Bilbo\u2019s acquaintance and nephew. Frodo was commanded to not use the ring, and follow Gandalf\u2019s directions to destroy the ring. After Bilbo left for one last journey, Gandalf has been watching him all along. Gandalf warns Frodo when Sauron wants the One Ring in his possession. The group consisting of Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin, venture for a group to go with. They set out for a man named Aragorn, an heir to a mighty kingdom. They venture through many hardships along the way. The group ends up in the land of the elves with Aragorn. After a battle with nearby forces, Frodo gets hurt. After healing him, the elves hold a council to determine the future of the ring. During so, Frodo learns the true meaning of the ring and knows why it should be destroyed. The council determines that they will send others on the trip to Mordor. Unfortunately, Gandalf dies while protecting the group in the caves of the dwarves. After a falling out with one of the group members, Frodo escapes with Sam to continue the journey to Mordor. Frodo develops very quickly through this part of the Lord of The Rings. After realizing the strength of the One Ring, Frodo knows he must destroy it.He soon becomes enthralled with it, using it just to use it for the simplest of things. He goes from a young hobbit to a person obsessed with the future the ring and not the rest of the group. Soon enough, Frodo finds himself obsessed with what the ring holds. Sam, Merry, and Pippin also come from the same background, but are soon noticing Frodo\u2019s attitude towards them is dwindling. They become Frodo\u2019s best friends during the journey and come to realize the real strength of the ring. The setting is in Middle Earth, along with the rest of the books Tolkien has written. This world is filled with many cities and walks of life. This land is also filled with different species and creatures. Within these borders of Middle Earth lies The Shire. The Shire is where most of the hobbits live, along with Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Merry. The mountainous area around the Shire is filled with orcs and goblins, breed to fight and kill. Mordor is the part of land after the ridge of mountains, containing Sauron and his evil army. I would recommend this book to most of the people I know. The age of the reader matters in these books, because of the language and grammar usage. Grades eight and up would be mature enough to know the content of this book. Overall, I really love this book and I hope others will too. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Connor", "stars": "5", "date": "Jan 19, 15", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           The journey to Middle Earth was painfully long and so, so, so slow. But it has finally ended. Gandalf's words of wisdom still echo in the back of the mind:  I've decided to spend the time to read the trilogy.And so, I have about three things to say to those of you uninitiated who are thinking about reading J.R.R. Tolkien's : As much as I like the fantasy setting of LoTR, Tolkien goes to extreme lengths to bore me with a slow paced, family friendly travelogue descriptions that can induce instant sleep, a feat that would put Gandalf's wizardry to shame. If you don't enjoy slow paced narrative - stay the hell away from these books. Watch the movies and be content. The driving force that got me through these books is, without a doubt, . This guy has created a crazily impressive audiobook, complete with potent voice acting, amazing sound effects and background music (Howard Shore). He has done the work all by himself, and managed to skillfully capture the atmosphere of Middle Earth. My reading routine was reading word-by-word with the audiobook for complete immersion. True, this has increased reading time substantially, but I think it was worth it. I commend you, Phil. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Peter Jackson's LoTR movie trilogy was  close to the source material. I love Jackson's movies, for the record. Not sure what Tolkien's son, Christopher, was smoking before saying shit like Perhaps he'd rather bore us all to death with selected poetry for 3 hours per movie, instead of Jackson's epic cinematic vision. My hat off to Jackson, in any case.Having said all that, I do hold a special place for Middle Earth & LoTR trilogy in my heart. Mayhap I won't be returning to the literary Middle Earth any time soon, but I'll surely revisit it one way or another every now and then.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Vov", "stars": "3", "date": "Jan 12, 15", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           This review was also posted at .I have read this book two times before when I was a lot younger. In my memory the story was very slow paced and at the time it took me very long to read. It might just not have been the right time to read it, because now that I read it again I went through it really fast. I love the world that Tolkien has created. The Hobbit was a nice introduction to this world, but in The lord of the Rings the world seems so much more fleshed out. In the book there are a lot of references to things that happened in the history of Middle Earth which made me feel like it was really a world that once existed. The main character Frodo is quite interesting and not a typical hero. He is definitely a brave person, but he is also spoiled and a little naive and cannot always manage on his own. He does have a bit of a black & white view of the world, but it didn't bother me, because the other characters in the book didn't all share that view. All the characters in this book were very different and it was easy to distinguish between who was saying what.One of the guys that follows Frodo on his quest, Sam, transforms quite wonderfully throughout the book. Or maybe it has more to do with the way he is described and you slowly find that there is more to him than meets the eye. In the beginning he just seems like a very loyal person who wants to follow Frodo everywhere and who is mostly excited to see the elves, as though he isn't really aware of the real danger the hobbits are in. Throughout the book he proves himself to be the most sceptic of all the characters, and very often this sceptism proves to be just. The book starts out quit light, but slowly builds up and gets darker as Frodo and his companions come to realise more and more what it is they are dealing with. Pippin is one of Frodo's friends who seems very naive at times, but the manages to lighten up the story in times when it gets dark. Tom Bombadil is one of my favorite characters. He is a little strange, but that is exactly what I liked about him. It would have liked to see him in the movie of the book as well, but sadly he is not.Tolkien's writing style might not be the most accesible, but I really enjoyed this book and I can't really think of anything I did not like about it.

However, evil had risen and the Dark Lord, Sauron, is searching for one special ring that will be able to rule all of the rings.

Hobbits were created by the author, J. R. R. Tlkien himself. One of the most significant relationships in this book is the relationship between Sam Gamgee and Frodo Baggins.

I decided to check this story out because of the fantasy element. This book did not disappoint and I think it is very well written. This novel starts off in the fictional land of Middle Earth. Instead of the modern society we live in today, Middle Earth seems to be set long ago, as swords and armor are still used for combat. This world is also home to many diverse and interesting species, the main three being the race of men, elves, and dwarves. Although it is mostly peaceful, there are also evil enemies lurking, of which the orcs are the most prevalent. \u201cThe Fellowship of the Ring\u201d begins with a series of events before the current time in Middle Earth. Bilbo Baggins, part of the hobbits, a race of short, peaceful people, stumbles upon a powerful ring that was made by the dark lord Sauron. From there, the main plot unfolds and Bilbo\u2019s nephew Frodo sets out on his journey to destroy the One Ring to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.Throughout his journey Frodo develops as a character, along with all of the main characters including Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Also, as the three characters that accompany Frodo are all from the three main races, it helps create a sense of unity and brotherhood amongst them. J.R.R. Tolkien does a phenomenal job creating the setting that this story takes place in. The Middle Earth environment is diverse with numerous kingdoms, forests, mountains, and oceans. Whether its the cozy feeling of the home of the hobbits in The Shire or the goblin filled Mines of Moria, you can be certain you will get lost in these lush worlds. Overall, \u201cThe Fellowship of the Ring\u201d is an amazing book that is certainly worth the time to read. J.R.R.

The terror of Smaug wasn't immediate nor was it palpable because his taking of The Lonely Mountain happened so long ago. But my meh-face at the plot doesn't change the fact that I adored Tolkien's way of, not only painting, but BUILDING, yes, BUILDING a world so complete that I can actually imagine these events as part of human history. Note that I used the word building and painting, that was intentional, some writers paint worlds that can be marveled and appreciated, Tolkien BUILT a world that can almost be touched.Back to The Fellowship of the Ring.

{"text": "\n           \n           The first time I read The Lord of the Rings, I was about thirteen and I remember thinking that it went on foreeeeeeeeeeeeeever and that there were big chunks of it that could easily be taken out without damaging the story. The second time I read the series was after Return of the King came out at the movies, and I was really confused about the fact that certain events that happen in the first movie do NOT happen in the first book etc etc.This time, the third time around, I read one or two chapters a night and savoured the book over the course of several weeks. And I loved it. There were still moments where I was like \"Tolkien, dude, get on with it\", but for the most part, those were few and far between.I'm not going to bother giving a basic recap of the story, because unless you've been living under a rock for the past million years, you know the basics, whether it be from reading the books, seeing the movies, or suffering through endless memes about not passing or walking into Mordor.I was a little surprised by how long certain events take to happen. It takes over 100 pages - almost a fifth of the book - for Frodo to even leave Bag End, and over 200 pages for the hobbits to reach Bree. Which doesn't mean that the stuff that happens in those 200 pages isn't good. Some of it is FABULOUS, especially the stuff involving Tom Bombadil and I'm now irrationally angry that he was left out of the movies because he's utterly brilliant. And the inclusion of a barrow-wight was rather unexpected but added a fantastic tone of creepiness to a book that's often just a bunch of blokes wandering about the landscape.Really, my only gripe would be the songs. I know they generally add history and depth to Middle-Earth, but did we REALLY need two full pages dedicated to Frodo's version of Hey Diddle Diddle?? I think not. But a Tolkien book without songs or poems is like an un-iced cupcake: sad and a little bit pointless. Especially when the non-Hey Diddle Diddle songs give us such perfect lines as \"Not all those who wander are lost\" and \"Home is behind, the world ahead\" (which never fails to make me tear up when Billy Boyd sings it in Return of the King).Basically, it was amazing from start to finish. There's a lot of build up for events that happen in the second and third books, but it never feels like Tolkien's saving all the action for further down the track. The characters are brilliant, and Tolkien's passion for the world he's created shines throughout. I don't think anyone on the face of the earth has ever put as much depth and history and attention to detail into their world-building as Tolkien did. I mean, he invented MULTIPLE LANGUAGES, for crying out loud. So yes. Fabulous world-building, fabulous characters, fabulous story telling, general fabulousness throughout.Onwards to The Two Towers!\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Kirsti (Melbourne on my mind)", "stars": "4", "date": "Apr 06, 15", "likes": "1"},

The theme of corruption is very lucid through-out the book because of \"The One Ring\" and its powers on the human man. Similar to the real world power corrupts. For example in politics this occurs with Senator and Representatives. In the book Frodo is chosen to carry the burden of the ring as the Fellowship travels to Mordor in order to destroy it. During this, Bormir's mind is corrupted by the ring once he touches it and he wants the ring all for himself. This is the first book of a three book series and in this book Tolkien describes the road to Mordor, but not all of the road there. Another pro for this book is the use of sensory details and imagery. Tolkien pours his darkest and most amazing thoughts into this book. This is what makes this book so creative and awesome. He uses a expanded vocabulary through-out the entire book. An example of this imagery and figurative language, \"For so it seemed to them: L\u00f3rien was slipping backward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees, sailing on to forgotten shores while they sat helpless upon the margin.\" This quote from the book describes the Elvish forest that they look back at while they're on their boats sailing towards Mordor, down the river. There is also a bond between two friends, Sam and Frodo. These two characters are relatable to people in the real world and in other books, like Lennie and George. Sam, Frodo and the rest of the Fellowship embark on this epic journey to destroy \"The One Ring\" and bring peace to Middle-Earth. This book was very well written and has next to no cons. There are really no cons that I could conceive after reading this book. This book held my attention all the way through until the end. One con could be that it is very long and some parts are a little boring, but every book is like that. Overall this book was great. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to escape reality and read about another world that is adventurous and action at every corner. This book is a great read and many people will enjoy it if they decide to read it. I would also recommend this book to someone who wants to learn more about fantasy books and enjoys fiction type books. I think that everyone should read this book because of its overall awesomeness. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "David Horten", "stars": "5", "date": "May 26, 14", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           \"Fellowship of the Ring\" is the first of the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, and in my opinion, it's the best of the Tolkien books. Tolkien's symbolism is rich and his world has profound meaning. The various races of middle earth correspond to types of people and spiritual creatures in our own world, and the struggles between them mirror the struggles in which we find ourselves, in both the physical and the spiritual contexts. If you have seen the movie, I would definitely recommend that you read the book as well. The book has some characters and some situations that are not included in the movie. In my opinion, the characters are richer in the book than in the movie, which is not surprising considering that only so much can be conveyed in a 3 hour movie. One of the things that does not come out in the movie is the symbolism of Galadriel and the huge role that she played in bringing the Fellowship together. In the movie, Galadriel is portrayed almost as a monster, a mind-reading witch who lusts after the power of the ring. But in the book she is much more. She is a great queen who transforms the elf and the dwarf from enemies into the best of friends, and who bestows on the members of the fellowship great gifts that would end up saving their lives and the quest later in the story. Tom Bombadil and the great nature motifs are so much more apparent in the book than in the movie as well.Tolkien tells us a great story of evil and the power of virtue to overcome it. The members of the fellowship struggle with the lust for power and, for the most part, they overcome it, but only at the cost of the fellowship. I think that all young people should read this book and discuss it. The ideas implicit in this book are powerful, and we need to think about them more. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Walter", "stars": "5", "date": "May 10, 14", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           Written Review for English1. I really wanted to read this book mainly because i had seen the movies and I really enjoyed them. Also the fact that i was just absolutely into fantasy genre books at the time of deciding to start reading Tolkien's work. 2. A character I found Interesting in the Book was Borimir in the end dies. He is the most honorable person n the book and he is the son of the steward of Gondor (the biggest city in Middle Earth). However throughout the course of the book the one ring starts to corrupt Borimir's heart and he starts to go mad, just after the peak of his madness he forefills his final deed to let the ring bearer escape when all of the orcs were ambushing the party. 3. A quote i enjoyed in the book was when when the Balrog (fiery daemon type monster) was chasing them through the mines of Moria, Gandalf said, \"run you fools! there is no stopping this monster! Swords will do nothing to its flame cloaked flesh! You will never forefill your quest assuming you don't run you fools!\" This put into perspective that it wasn't tea and picnics and that there will always be something much much stronger than them. This was a big stepping point in the book as the mood changed from: walk over and forefill a noble destiny to stuff like the character just running for their lives at every corner as there i always someone or something bigger and badder than themselves.4. From reading this book I feel that I will struggle to find a better book to read because it was really really good. I also felt that the fact that there is always someone better at something than you was shown to me and i kind of only then really thought about it in detail and that.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Nick Merlini", "stars": "4", "date": "May 31, 14", "likes": "1"},

Pentru c\u0103 Tolkien are ni\u0219te descrieri destul de lungi, iar eu nu sunt tocmai fan. De aceea mi-a \u0219i luat at\u00e2t de mult timp s\u0103 citesc cartea asta. Mi-a trebuit a lun\u0103, \u00een cazul \u00een care era\u021bi curio\u0219i.Cred c\u0103 mai toat\u0103 lumea \u0219tie despre ce este vorba \u00een St\u0103p\u00e2nul inelelor, despre Frodo care are sarcina de a avea Inelul asupra lui \u0219i de a-l distruge. Nu cred c\u0103 e nevoie s\u0103 mai spun ceva despre subiectul acestei c\u0103r\u021bi, nu? \u00cen primul r\u00e2nd, trebuie s\u0103 spun c\u0103 Tolkien a reu\u0219it s\u0103 creeze o lume ce ar putea la fel de bine s\u0103 fie real\u0103, pentru c\u0103 nu a\u0219 avea nicio problem\u0103 \u00een a crede c\u0103 este \u00eentr-adev\u0103r. Tocmai din acest motiv am \u0219i continuat s\u0103 tot citesc, cu toate c\u0103 descrierile lui pot fi un pic obositoare la un moment dat. Dar nimic nu mi s-a p\u0103rut a fi inutil \u00een tot ce a povestit \u0219i \u00een tot ce a descris el \u00een carte. \u0218i tocmai de aceea am continuat, pentru c\u0103 \u0219tiam din experien\u021ba mea cu Hobbitul c\u0103 la final totul avea s\u0103 merite. \u0218i a\u0219a a \u0219i fost. La final, c\u00e2nd am \u00eenchis cartea, am r\u0103mas cu o senza\u021bie de uau, Tolkien chiar avea imagina\u021bie.S\u0103 zic ceva \u0219i despre personaje. Prefera\u021bii mei ar fi Gandalf, Frodo, Sam \u0219i Aragorn. Sam mi s-a p\u0103rut a fi un prieten a\u0219a de bun pentru Frodo, niciodat\u0103 nu l-ar l\u0103sa la greu, indiferent ce ar \u00eensemna asta, \u0219i \u00eel cunoa\u0219te foarte bine, el e unul din cele mai simpatice personaje din carte pentru mine. Iar Frodo e mult mai curajos dec\u00e2t am crezut c\u0103 va fi, ceea ce aduce puncte \u00een plus c\u0103r\u021bii. Despre Gandalf \u0219i Aragorn nu mai explic, m-a\u0219 lungi prea mult.Chestia cu c\u0103r\u021bile lui Tolkien, \u00een viziunea mea, e cam a\u0219a: \u00een c\u0103r\u021bile lui se c\u0103l\u0103tore\u0219te destul de mult, iar pe parcurs personajele trec prin tot felul de chestii, care le schimb\u0103 \u00een cele din urm\u0103, \u0219i apoi ajung s\u0103 fac\u0103 ni\u0219te lucruri pe care nu credeau c\u0103 ar fi fost \u00een stare s\u0103 le fac\u0103. \u0218i exact asta \u00eemi place mie la Tolkien, c\u0103 arat\u0103 cumva cum se pot schimba oamenii dac\u0103 sunt pu\u0219i \u00een anumite situa\u021bii, \u0219i cum fiecare e mai mult dec\u00e2t crede \u0219i pare c\u0103 e la \u00eenceput. Asta s-a \u00eent\u00e2mplat \u0219i \u00een Hobbitul \u0219i a fost ceea ce a schimbat mult \u00een bine p\u0103rerea mea despre acea carte. \u0218i fiecare popor, c\u0103 nu \u0219tiu cum s\u0103 \u00eei zic altfel, are propriul lui fel de a fi, \u0219i mi s-a p\u0103rut c\u0103 asta a fost foarte bine ar\u0103tat \u00een carte, pentru c\u0103 sunt destule popoare diferite: hobbi\u021bi, elfi, gnomi, oameni. Iar grupul lui Frodo fiind format din membri ai fiec\u0103ruia, mi-a pl\u0103cut c\u0103 \u00eentr-un fel se completau reciproc, adic\u0103 fiecare g\u00e2ndea \u00eentr-un fel \u0219i la final puteau lucra \u00eempreun\u0103 pentru a atinge un scop final. Ar mai fi o singur\u0103 chestie pe care vreau s\u0103 o zic. Dac\u0103 vre\u021bi s\u0103 \u00eencepe\u021bi trilogia asta, pentru c\u0103 sigur sunt persoane care nu au citit-o, ar avea mai mult sens s\u0103 \u00eencepe\u021bi cu Hobbitul pentru c\u0103 introduce cumva lumea lui Tolkien \u00eentr-un mod mai simplu, fiind de fapt o carte pentru copii, e un basm. \u0218i \u00een felul \u0103sta se poate s\u0103ri peste acea introducere din primul volum, destul de lung\u0103 \u0219i cred eu plictisitoare.

{"text": "\n           \n           Quel plaisir de se replonger dans les aventures de Bilbon, Frodon, Merry & Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas et Gandalf! Apr\u00e8s avoir vu au moins cinq fois chacun des films, il \u00e9tait temps que je me mette aux livres. Entre le Seigneur des Anneaux et moi, c'est une grande histoire d'amour et ma premi\u00e8re plong\u00e9e dans la fantasy, \u00e0 la sortie des films. Harry Potter \u00e9tait sortit ou allait sortir \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, et notre \u00e9cole primaire nous emmenais un samedi par mois au cin\u00e9ma. On avait vu le tout premier Harry Potter, et en sortant de la salle, j'ai vu l'affiche du SdA. Rentrant chez moi le soir, j'ai parl\u00e9 avec mes parents, histoire de les convaincre d'aller voir \"Le seigneur des Agneaux\" (oui, agneaux). Bon, une fois au cin\u00e9ma, il n'\u00e9tait plus question d'un animal mais d'un anneaux. Du coup, on est quand m\u00eame aller le voir, et depuis je voue un culte \u00e0 cette saga...Pas la peine de faire un m\u00e9ga r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l'affaire, vous la connaissez tous, au moins. Bilbon l\u00e8gue son anneau trouv\u00e9 dans \"Bilbo le Hobbit\" \u00e0 Frodon, avant de partir \u00e0 Fondcombe. Sauf que voil\u00e0, ce n'est pas un simple anneau ordinaire: C'est l'Anneau Unique, jadis celui de Sauron, le Seigneur des T\u00e9n\u00e8bres avant Voldemort. Frodon est donc charg\u00e9 d'une seule et unique mission: d\u00e9truire l'Anneau dans la Montagne du Destin, avant que Sauron et ses sbires mettent la main dessus.Le livre est 10 000 fois mieux au film. Le film est beau, g\u00e9nial, mais passe au dessus de plein d'\u00e9v\u00e8nements et de personnages qui ont tellement d'importance. J'ai par exemple d\u00e9couvert Tom Bombadil, Glorifindel, les fils d'Elrond, et une pl\u00e9thore de personnages plus int\u00e9ressant les uns que les autres.Le voyage de Frodon est tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9. Il y a des tonnes et des tonnes de descriptions, si bien que l'on sait ce qu'a fait chaque jour le Porteur de l'Anneau durant son voyage. Agr\u00e9ment\u00e9 de chants, on en d\u00e9couvre beaucoup sur l'histoire de la Terre du Milieu et de ses habitants. Les lecteurs pourrait trouver ces longues descriptions et chants de six pages r\u00e9barbatif, mais ayant commenc\u00e9 Tolkien par \"Bilbo le Hobbit\", \u00e7a ne m'a pas plus d\u00e9rang\u00e9e que \u00e7a, aillant d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu un aper\u00e7u de son travail.Lire cette saga, c'est le bien pour quiconque voudrait en savoir plus sur la qu\u00eate de l'Anneau et sa communaut\u00e9, ainsi que la Terre du Milieu. Une certaine continuit\u00e9 s'\u00e9tant install\u00e9e entre Bilbo le Hobbit et SdA (comme avec les trolls chang\u00e9s en pierre), lire ce livre vous am\u00e8nera irr\u00e9m\u00e9diablement \u00e0 lire l'autre, vous \u00eates pr\u00e9venus.Du coup, j'ai tellement bien aim\u00e9 ce premier tome, que je lirais le deuxi\u00e8me le mois prochain! :)\n         ", "book": "La Communaut\u00e9 de l'Anneau (Le Seigneur des Anneaux, #1)", "user": "S\u00e9verine", "stars": "5", "date": "Jul 15, 14", "likes": "1"},

What an adventure!That was the road trip of ALL ROAD TRIPS!The Fellowship of the Ring was an exhausting read that took me a while to push through sometimes. It was exhausting and thrilling! The pace was a little slow sometimes but it also felt intentional, how else was I to feel the long journey across the Shire and to Rivendell and through Moira? I felt everything the characters felt and they were mighty tired a lot of the times, and scared, and in wonder of all there was to see and experience. It was truly rewarding to finish this book and it makes me anticipate what is to come in the rest of the trilogy. Tolkien has such a way of writing that in every chapter, and with every danger, once I read past it, I realize that I was so drawn into the story that I felt cold when they (the fellowship) did, or tired when they did, or happy when they did, or sad and filled with a feeling of hopelessness when they did. And the world Tolkien created! It was so vast and the only way to describe it, the only way to do it justice, is to describe it as the epitome of an EPIC. There was such a thoughtfulness of history, language, character background, and world building.The best part is, having read The Hobbit, I still got to revisit the stories from that adventure and the characters from it.This book is amazing and I sense that it can only get better and better.

{"text": "\n           \n           Of course we know that a lot of material was left out of the Peter Jackson movies. That is what makes these books worth reading: there is more to discover.A little too much, actually.Each of the three Lord of the Rings books are actually divided into two \"Books\" which gives the overall story a bit of a split personality.Book I begins with Bilbo's party and ends right before Frodo arrives at Rivendell. What is surprising is about 90% of this portion of the book is nowhere to be found in the movies. This is anything but a prose version of the movie. What you get instead is an adventure full of subplots that the movie doesn't even hint at. Most of it is fun to read and it recalls the fairy-tale-adventure feeling that Tolkien did in The Hobbit.But the momentum hits a wall in Book II.At the beginning of Book II you are greeted by the Council of Elrond which makes the movie version look like a quick chat. It goes on and on and on and on.And it is here where Tolkien introduces the issue that he is most criticized for: dense history.Names upon names upon names are dropped giving a strong sense of a solid history...that you have no clue about.To the average reader, this is difficult to get through. You simply have no idea what they are talking about.That would normally be fine. Backstory is not as important as the main narrative. But the main narrative drowns in this stuff. Also adding the lackluster second half is that about 99% of it makes it into the movie. So the familiarity may encourage some skimming and scanning.What I like most about reading The Fellowship of the Ring is the little subtle differences that work better in novel form than film.Boromir's betrayal and the hints leading up to it are slightly different. The idea of Gandalf being the leader and his death leaving them uncertain as to how to continue. Most importantly is Frodo's reason for leaving the Fellowship. His thought process is more specific than the more feel-good message at the end of the movie.All of this definitely makes for a more fully developed legend, but not a seamless one. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Mark", "stars": "3", "date": "May 16, 14", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           Samantha DunlapThe Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien is an epic fantasy novel with 423 pages, known and loved nationwide by countless fans. I chose this novel partially because of its popularity: my mom is also a Lord of the Rings geek.The Fellowship of the Ring follows the beginning of Frodo Baggins' quest to destroy the all-powerful, all-evil Ring he inherited from Bilbo Baggins, his relative and mentor. As Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring are thrust into peril and revelation, he finds his quest to be much more important than he first thought. One member of the Fellowship that I found full of depth and wisdom is Aragorn, the mysterious and skilled Ranger. He has an aura of weariness and perhaps sorrow about him throughout the book, and appears to have secrets that I am eager to find- even though I have watched the movies. Also, a literary element that stood out to me was imagery. The way Tolkien used description to paint fabulous pictures of the scenery surrounding the characters, and also the characters themselves, was almost Shakespearean in its detail.I fell in love with this book the way Hazel from The Fault in our Stars describes falling in love: slowly, then all at once. It is truly what others have made the Lord of the Rings out to be, and even more. I would recommend it to everyone. Well, everyone who is able and willing to comprehend the literature and density of the book.Especially since we began the meta-cognitive reading logs, I have been thinking more about literary elements, and what the author uses to portray a certain theme.

My next step in achieving it is (after reading Pathfinder, a novel by Orson Scott Card, the author of the Ender's Game series) to read The Two Towers, of course.

{"text": "\n           \n           THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING by J.R.R Tolkien is a fantasy classic with a brilliantly crafted plot and an immersive world.In this first volume of THE LORD OF THE RINGS epic, young hobbit Frodo and his two companions must leave the comforts of the Shire on a quest to destroy the dreaded One Ring, a source of power coveted by the Dark Lord Sauron. Sauron will use all the evil at his disposal to acquire the ring and use its powers to enslave Middle-earth. Frodo and his friends are joined by warriors from each of the factions of Middle-earth, who have sworn to protect the hobbits from the dangers that await them. Whether traveling through the awe-inspiring Elven halls in Rivendell or the ominous mines of Moria, Frodo and his companions are faced with daunting challenges at every turn. And with the corrupting force of the ring slowly infecting the hearts of the comrades, the fellowship that supports Frodo is soon shaken.While THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is incredibly dense with information and descriptions, it is well worth a read for its well-drawn characters, surprising moments of humor, and tightly written action. The world is so intricately constructed, it is hard to believe that it came from the mind of one person.

{"text": "\n           \n           Having now completed the trilogy, I find it difficult to write my review. I fell in love with middle-earth when I was ten years old and saw Peter Jackson\u2019s masterpiece. A few years ago, I read The Hobbit and was enthralled by Tolkien\u2019s storytelling. Thus, I came to the conclusion that The Lord of the Rings epic would be a combination of Jackson\u2019s story and Tolkien\u2019s writing so I should get off my lazy arse and finally read it! I could not have been more wrong. Tolkien\u2019s storytelling does a complete 180 and feels totally different from the Hobbit. To put it simply, I was bored for 95% of the story. There is so much useless information provided and just seemed never ending. Why on Earth would I want to know what happened to the bloody ponies the hobbits rode for all of five minutes? The story is also amazingly slow paced. \u201cWe must be not waste time and destroy the Ring\u2026 but first let\u2019s spend a couple of months hanging out with Elrond.\u201d Next: the characters. There is not one likable character no matter how hard you look. This is for the simple fact that no one has any personality \u2013 not even Gollum who has two. Everyone is just an empty shell of a different race and I couldn\u2019t feel anything for any of them. This brings me to Tom Sodding Bombadil.

I could rant forever but I\u2019ll end by saying that I did give this trilogy my best shot. I so desperately wanted to enjoy it but it, sadly, just wasn\u2019t for me.

{"text": "\n           \n           I can never get bored of this story!The first third of my favourite book of all time. I find myself swept back into the peaceful warm Hobbit life of the Shire with the familiar Bagginses. Bilbo is older but very much unchanged! There is a peace to the shire that is so beautifully written and difficult to leave behind. It is a world in itself and you grow to love the characters of home.The world created in Tolkien's mind never fails to paint such an amazing picture. He has such a great understanding of how the world is constructed that he creates something that feels equally as real. Even the magic and the unfamiliar places (such as the Elven places) are painted so vividly. To open the first page of Lord of the Rings is to step foot in the most immersive and incredibly crafted world I have ever had the pleasure of reading.The history of Middle Earth astounds me, and the impact it has all had upon the world to the time of Lord of the Rings is amazing. So many stories that leave you wanting to discover more and you find yourself sucked deeper into this beautiful world.There is so much to love about how they are swept into their adventure that I really find it hard to begin. So I will start with my thoughts of Gandalf.Gandalf begins the story as the strange wizard friend who makes quite an impact in the Shire with his playful magic and unfamiliar ways. Now as Hobbits love their sure comfortable lives, Gandalf comes as quite an odd one to the peaceful Shirefolk.Throughout the story Frodo always trusts Gandalf's words and as they go through new and unfamiliar places, Gandalf leads with a great wisdom and brings great comfort and security to the fellowship. For me, it was only really AFTER the incident in the Mines of Moria and during the visit to Lothlorien that you really fully appreciate Gandalf's importance and wisdom. You are reminded of his greatness and how difficult things are without him. His character is so deep from his friendly and witty remarks to his quick to anger comments and insults that keep the fellowship in line.My favourite male character is Samwise. Although his best moments are in the later parts, in my opinion, you cannot help but love him. He is so well rooted to home and the most faithful friend you could ever wish for. Sam provides a comfort within the story that brings you back home to the Shire. I feel home has always been a great subject within Tolkien's works and to leave the comforts of it would be for a very worthy cause. Sam is pure of heart and he understands Frodo better than anyone.My favourite passage was the introduction of Aragorn: \"He had a tall tankard in front of him, and was smoking a long-stemmed pipe curiously carved. His legs were stretched out before him, showing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well, but had seen so much wear and were now caked with mud. A travel-stained cloak of heavy dark-green cloth was drawn close about him, and in spite of the heat of the room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbits\"Never has a character been introduced so perfectly. A man who had seen much yet sat shrouded in such mystery that you cannot help but be curious. Even throughout the Fellowship part of the book, you cannot help but wonder about what this once-stranger has to hide. He is strong and kind hearted and always knows the best thing to say. A worthy leader.Frodo is very wise for a hobbit. I always found him to be quite quiet until perhaps the end part of the Fellowship. Frodo is always wanting to do the right thing and he considers everyone that he meets. He takes it upon himself to be kind to all those that he meets and to bear whatever burden he must for the greater good. He never complains, not really, and it took a big man to carry all that he did.Merry and Pippin are interesting. Through Fellowship you always knew there was something more to them, although they seem much less essential in this part you always get the feeling that they will soon play a much greater part in it all. I learnt from LOTR:When all else may fail, why not Hobbits? No one expected Hobbits! Friendship is a major part of the story for me, Gimli and Legolas (you saw that one coming!) are prime examples. History and pride of their own cultures pinned them as rivals upon their first meet and they both begin pretty stubborn and ignorant. As the story develops they learn to appreciate eachother's' people and ways and learn that despite everything they were led to believe... An elf and a dwarf can indeed be friends. I found this helped me a lot growing up to understand that prejudice gets you no where and not to judge someone on what they are but more... Who they are. And there is good in everyone. I found myself smiling mostly at the moments between Gimli and Legolas.What of Boromir? I love the complexity of this man! He is so beaten and at war with himself. He only wants to do good for his people but he does show a great flaw in Man that cannot be helped. I cannot hate Boromir because he never wished to hurt anybody, he has so much conflict within his personality that you can just understand that he is only human. I still found that his \"moment\" towards the end was much scarier than those with any of the orcs or other dark creatures of the book because I always had trust in him and believed in his strength. Which makes the opening of Two Towers much more hard hitting after his repent.I could go on forevermore because I feel that, especially in the Fellowship, the characters truly came to life and there is a lot to them. I have always loved the elves and their way of thinking and I love all this book has to offer. Oh Middle Earth <3I'm sorry how badly this review is written and structured but being the first third of my favourite book of all time, I cannot get my thoughts straight! The most incredible start to something that has always been embedded deeply in my heart. I would loved to have met Tolkien to tell him of my love for his world. He is a great influential writer who will live on forever in his words and his world!

Not because I was bored, but because I was severely impatient and it would tickle my nerd pickle so that I would jump straight to watching the movies, and give up reading for yet another year.This time my resolve won out and what a adventure I had missed out on.

What makes Lord of the Rings so great for young people in my opinion is a clear delineation between good and evil. The races of the free world may not get along so well, but they are not evil. That is why  is my favorite character. It may be because of my biases of watching the movies first, cause Sean Bean is a bad ass! He plays the perfect wise warrior. It's too bad he always dies, but maybe that's what it makes him so memorable for me. His characters stand for what they believe and death does not put a stay to that belief.

I for one adore all the lore and the descriptions. For instance the Mines of Moria were a little bit of a mystery to me, who the hell was the guy in the tomb? It looked to me like the mines were long since abandoned for Gimli to get so upset by it, but now I know the deal and it was a fantastic history lesson. There is to much to explore and have opinions about to place in this small space, but !Cant wait to finish off the series (including  and ) and hit the more recent Unfinished Tales and the rest of what his son Christopher has released on the tales of Middle Earth.Go read it.Read it to your kids.Enjoy.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Jason Rogers", "stars": "5", "date": "Mar 01, 14", "likes": "1"},

{"text": "\n           \n           The first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy The Fellowship of the Ring, is about Frodo Baggins embarkment on the epic journey of destroying the One Ring which belongs to the dark lord Sauran. Bilbo Baggins came across this Ring on his journeys in The Hobbit. This Ring has a will of it's own and is always trying to get back to his Master (the dark lord). The book starts with Bilbo's birthday party. He puts the ring on, which makes him invisible, and disappears before the crowd. Bilbo has decided to leave his home town to depart to Rivendell, a home of the elves, but is persuaded by Gandalf to leave the ring with his nephew Frodo. The Ring has some kind of hold over Bilbo so it's surprising he is even able to forcefully part with it. The Ring subverts your mind into never wanting to part with it and makes it's bearer completely obsessed with it. If worn long enough it prolongs your life but can also turn you into no more than a ghost of a creature, who can be subverted to serve the dark forces of power. So this first book in the trilogy is about the beginning of Frodo's journey where he needs to take the Ring into the fires of Mordor to destroy it, will he be able to or will the Ring have to much of a powerful hold on poor Frodo and what dangers will he come across on his journey? - Asif Zamir\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Asif Zamir", "stars": "5", "date": "Mar 11, 14", "likes": "1"},

{"text": "\n           \n           This review is for the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Hobbit. Basically, the whole series was great and I loved it and recommend it. I read it about a decade ago; I don't precisely remember when. I bypassed the book during the 1960's and 1970's when everyone else my age (I'm a boomer) read the book. But when I heard the movie was coming out, I read he entire series BEFORE I saw the movie.I do have a few things to say about LOTR and Christianity, namely, is The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) Christian in its intent or effect? For the complete review, check out my website at compassionatespirit.com. Various arguments could and have been brought forward to answer this question. It could be argued that LOTR manifests Christian influences. Tolkien was a strict Roman Catholic. The tale seems to be one of good versus evil. The good characters exemplify Christian virtues such as perseverance, honesty, humbleness, loyalty, and so forth. On the other hand, it could be argued that LOTR is not Christian. \"Good versus evil\" is a common theme in many different religions, not just Christianity. There are no references to any religions, or to God, to God-like Creatures, or to an overarching moral code. In fact, the single figure in the book which comes closest to resembling God is the evil Sauron himself, whose \"eye\" sweeps the world much as we might imagine God would do.But these details are not nearly as important as the question of violence. Violence plays a key role in the plot of LOTR. Does Tolkien present violence in a Christian, or an anti-Christian way? Anyone who says \"love your enemies\" and \"do not violently resist one who is evil\" must favor peaceful outcomes. This point could of course be argued, but that is not my purpose here. For purposes of this essay, I am assuming that Jesus was in fact nonviolent, and that true Christianity (whatever various pseudo-Christian ideologues might claim) is also nonviolent. If Tolkien is trying to justify violence, then it would seem that this is an anti-Christian theme. There certainly are a lot of battle scenes, so for anyone trying to find a pacifist message in LOTR, rather than a glorification of war, there doesn't seem to be a lot to hope for. Reading LOTR, one seems to be caught up in a world which is very similar to how we remember the Second World War: as an epic struggle of good versus evil. For most of us, the Second World War was surely justified: and surely the violence used in resisting the evil Sauron in LOTR would be justified. But how does LOTR call forth these images, and what do they tell us? I think it is best just to admit at the outset that the way in which Tolkien is able to evoke the ethos of the Second World War, in a mythical way, is absolutely uncanny. In both the battles of Middle Earth and the Second World War we had an epic, universal struggle of good versus evil. Many tried to remain neutral, but found it impossible. Frodo, Gandalf, and friends are not just up against a personal evil, but against universal evil, involving them in a struggle which obliterates all other petty struggles and concerns. But just how does Tolkien do this? Explanations as to how this is done often come up short. People have tried to identify Sauron with Hitler, and you might try to draw an analogy between the Hobbits, the humans, and the Western democracies, but these kinds of crude comparisons generally fall flat. What Tolkien does is to evoke the social context of a great crisis, and that is what makes LOTR \"feel\" like the Second World War. Social relationships in a time of crisis are fundamentally different from social relationships at other times. It is not at the level of the individual, but at the level of society, that the vividness of the struggle between good and evil is brought to light. LOTR achieves the \"feel\" of the Second World War not through its characterization of individuals, but through its characterization of society. So far, so good; but when we try to push the analogy between LOTR and the Second World War, it starts to break down. The most important problem is the characterization of the \"bad guys.\" If LOTR is a parable of the Second World War and the need to confront aggression (or however you want to read the Second World War), then where are the Germans in LOTR? Presumably, the Germans are the bad guys: Sauron is Hitler, the Orcs are the German armies, and so forth. But in that case, and if it is a parable of the Second World War, what would be contained in the non-existent fourth volume of the LOTR trilogy, in which the tales of what happened in Middle Earth after this epic confrontation are found? In real life, the Soviet Union and the Western allies then engaged in a dangerous \"cold war.\" The fourth volume would then have to show how the Dwarves fell out with their Hobbit and human allies, and both sides armed themselves to the teeth, possessing weapons even more terrifying than any that had been used in the previous struggle. But even more bizarre is how Tolkien would have to dispose of the Orcs. In real life, Germany and Japan became some of American's closest allies. Sauron is gone, so presumably this fourth volume would show how the Orcs suddenly come to their senses. After having their realms occupied by legions of friendly Hobbits and humans, and after being re-educated, would they adopt the freedom-loving habits of the Hobbits and spread gardens throughout the land of Mordor? Would they elect new leaders, and would Orcs then become a trusted ally of the Hobbits? Would the Uruk-Hai and Nazgul have been taught to eat tofu, and all settled down to become peaceful farmers, employing wargs as beasts of burden? Even allowing that anyone would want to write, or read, such a fourth volume of LOTR, this doesn't fit at all. The enemies of the Shire must not merely be vanquished, they must be destroyed or at least completely isolated. They are of an alien race. The attempts to describe Orc social life show how ludicrous the idea of integration of the Orcs into the rest of Middle Earth Society is. The best the Orcs can hope for, once they are defeated, is to be exiled to a part of Middle Earth where they will do no harm. We cannot envision a multi-cultural future society of Middle Earth in which Orcs and Hobbits will all dwell together. They really do belong to a different race. Tolkien cannot be accused of simple racism here: clearly there are some races in Middle Earth, such as humans and Hobbits, which can co-exist; there are others, such as elves and dwarfs, which are antagonistic to each other but which can learn to cooperate. And there is certainly no dispensation from LOTR for one set of humans to regard another set of humans, of different religion or different ancestry, as vermin.However, we can see in the LOTR myth a reflection of the way in which the Nazis saw the world. For these other races of beings in LOTR are simply inherently different. And what makes the evil nations in LOTR evil, is not that they have chosen evil, but that they are evil. This is exactly how the Nazis saw their racial enemies. There was nothing specifically immoral with them, but -- like termites or rats -- they simply had to be destroyed. LOTR does not merely represent in mythical form how we saw the Second World War. It also represents, in mythical form, how many Germans saw the Second World War (with a different ending, of course). In fact, in this respect it probably represents the German point of view better than it does that of the Western Allies. In fact, this way of viewing \"the enemy\" represents how we -- and virtually every nation -- saw its enemies, during the war. The U. S. A. interned the Japanese Americans during the war; and while they were treated much better than their Jewish counterparts in Nazi Germany, who knows what would have happened had the Japanese been advancing massively and steadily towards the American countryside, first to Hawaii, then to Mexico, then to California? American soldiers similarly had to learn to hate their Korean, Vietnamese, and Iraqi opponents in subsequent wars. The good news is that we suspended this belief shortly after our victory. Our World War Two enemies -- Germany and Japan -- later became our closest allies. But for the duration of the war, we acted as if those opposing us were monsters to be eliminated.The \"Second World War\" analogy tells us more about ourselves than about Tolkien. In Middle Earth, the orcs really are biologically different from humans. That we nevertheless experience the Middle Earth crisis as \"like\" the Second World War, tells us that during this vicious conflict, everyone experienced their opponents, at least the opposing soldiers, as Orc-like beings. Some took this comparison further than others; the Germans, evidently, extended it to include even civilian Jews. Tolkien spends little time in mourning the tragedy of the deaths of so many Orcs killed in a struggle which they barely understood. This is the chief anti-Christian feature of LOTR. At least at first blush, it glorifies violence as necessary, and presents us the image of violence as not merely a political inevitability but as an almost biological inevitability. This was the viewpoint of most of the opposed nations in the Second World War, but it reflects no one's viewpoint as accurately as it represents that of the Germans. But there is another way of looking at Tolkien's story which undoes everything which has gone on before. Tolkien's story does not offer us a single message about violence, but two messages, both contradictory to each other. The second message is contained in the significance of the ring itself. What precisely does the plot device of the ring contribute to the story? The ring represents power, but a special kind of power. It is a weapon, the mere possession of which is evil, regardless of the intentions of the user. We normally think of a sword, a bomb, or a gun, as being in itself \"neutral.\" In the hands of the rightful authorities, it maintains order; in the hands of a criminal, or an evil nation, it creates destruction. The ring is not this kind of weapon. It is inherently evil, no matter what the subjective purpose of the wearer is. Sam, when he briefly wears the ring, begins to be overcome with visions of Hobbit-gardens overtaking all of Middle Earth, with himself as the prophet of this new order. Had he continued to wear the ring, all might have been lost. Frodo, of course, also briefly wears the ring, but this perhaps in conjunction with his constant carrying of the ring is enough to tempt him, at the end of the story, to actually put on the ring instead of casting it into Mt. Doom. What in our modern world -- or in our mythos of the Second World War -- does the ring stand for? It might stand for atomic weapons, which cannot be used without destroying civilization. Yet one nation, the United States, continued to possess this \"ring,\" and even use it once. In time, a total of seven nations have come to acquire this power. This ring has not only not been destroyed, but has proliferated. So if this is what Tolkien is getting at, then the Second World War does not correspond at all with the mythos of LOTR. Instead of the Second World War destroying the ring, it would have proliferated it. There is something else which the Ring could stand for: it is the power of war and greed itself. Without the enchantment of power, violence, and greed, what would happen? Nations would collapse and people, even beings of different races, would live together in peace. \"You may say I'm a dreamer,\" but that's the other message of LOTR, whether we agree with it or not. The fact is, that the central plot device of the ring is totally dissimilar to anything in the historical, or even the mythic, Second World War. But what have we done historically, after seizing the ring and breaking Hitler's spell and his power? We have kept the ring for ourselves. In other words we have used the same weapons that Hitler used. We have tried to use the ring wisely, but it has still had a corrupting influence. Thankfully, in Vietnam, Korea, and Iraq, Americans did not use this power as much as Hitler did. But today, we again confront the same sort of lawless, violent world that we saw in the 1920's and 1930's. Governments wage opportunistic wars, relying on past justified grievances to advance their own agenda. Others are being tempted to take this ring from us. There's an obvious lesson here: the ring must be destroyed, but it is still loose in the world. LOTR, therefore, could be read as an allegory rather than a straightforward story about war. The ring is (except for very brief and very dangerous episodes) exclusively a power for evil. The ring is the enforcer of evil, and stands for all the things which nations use to force or induce people into evil actions: ignorance, the enchantment of war, the picture of our enemies as inherently evil, power, greed, and wealth. Even if one must use it, ever so briefly, because of a specific tactical situation which demands it, one must immediately afterwards put it aside, or one is in fatal danger. Even the minimal use made of the ring is too much for Frodo, who at the end cannot cast the ring into the fire. Once the ring is destroyed, the power of evil melts away, without any need to resort to violence.You cannot fight Sauron with the ring. Rather, the ring must simply be destroyed and not used at all. We can break this spell by destroying the ring. That is a struggle truly worth engaging in. The ring becomes the sword that Jesus warned Peter against, because those who acquire power through the ring, are destroyed by that ring. Hitler was not a uniquely evil individual in history. Hitler was a typical tyrant in uniquely incendiary conditions. Today the conditions are even more incendiary than they were in the 1930's: we have atomic weapons, racial conflicts, religious hatreds, gross and growing disparity between rich and poor, and an incipient environmental crisis which will force us to fundamentally restructure our society and the world economy or be destroyed. Hitler is long dead, but instead of dealing with these problems, we are still on Mount Doom, struggling among ourselves as to which of us will have his ring. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Keith Akers", "stars": "4", "date": "Jun 23, 11", "likes": "1"},

Hence, it was easier reading this one, since there were no distractions in the writing that diverted me from the focus of the story.How\u2019s your pace going? Is it smooth sailing or have you found passages that are difficult to get through?I didn't find any difficulty weaving through the passages, though once in a while, I was guilty of scanning through a para or two where the skies and the greenery and the beauty of the damsels are described. (In my defense, I sort of already know what the paragraphs are extolling. :-) ) Overall though, my pace was pretty decent without any hitches or bumps!If you\u2019ve read this series before, is The Fellowship of the Ring, for the most part, as you remembered? If not, is it what you expected or something else? The Fellowship of the Ring is as I remembered it, except at one point - the scene at the Ford of Rivendell, where I confused the facts from the book and those shown in the movie. Glorfindel is the elf that rescues the group at the Ford in the book, whereas in the movie, it is Arwen (predictably to avoid introducing too many characters).Are you using any of the extra features- maps and indexes, for instance- in your book?I kept perusing the maps at many points. It's a little hard since the maps are part of regular pages in a Paperback, and not like any pull-out posters. I haven't really made much use of the index yet, except to study the Hobbit family tree, which, I should say is so complicated, it's funny that the Hobbits really remember it.Do Books One and Two have significant differences to you?I wouldn't really say differences, but I felt the demarcation between the two stronger than when I previously read it. The first part deals with the travel of the group to Rivendell and the various dangers they faced. Book 2 is when most of the characters that become household figures are actually introduced. This is when we get acquainted with the rest of the Fellowship. Moreover, Book One is lighter than Book Two, which marks the beginning of the journey and adventures of the Fellowship.Who\u2019s your favorite character so far into the novel?That would be a contest between Pippin and Sam, but I think Pippin would win in the end. His jokes and light-heartedness are a constant delight to read amidst all the gloom. Sam's devotion to his master and his insistence on making Frodo comfortable are very endearing to read. His excitement on meeting the Elves for the first time, was so infectious!What surprised you the most?There weren't very many surprises that I came across, other than the realization that Glorfindel rather than Arwen was with the traveling group in the last leg before Rivendell. In addition, I had quite forgotten that Frodo sells his house at Bag End before embarking on his trip.What was your favorite scene?This has been a constant over the years - the Council of Elrond. I like how the different characters come together to explain their role in the story so far, and how Bilbo cheekily agrees to be the Ring-bearer! But what I like the most is the pages and pages of intense and fluid discussion among the characters, each person's nature very evident in their analyses and beliefs and also in their stance throughout. Even in the movie, this remains my favorite scene!\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Athira (Reading on a Rainy Day)", "stars": "5", "date": "Apr 13, 10", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           This is the first volume of the novel 'The Lord of the Rings' (no, it's not a trilogy, explains the notes in the version that I read;  is a mammoth of a novel, comprised of six books, usually compiled into three volumes; the first volume popularly known as the Fellowship of the Ring).I read this volume first in Indonesian and I was disinterested after finishing the first book. It felt boring and bland. But then a friend of mine lent me hers, which is in English. And, yeah, I really like it. Granted, many of us will find the details superfluous and the pace a bit slow (especially if you compare the novel with the film). But the details are amazing - you can make a very detailed map of the Middle-Earth and trace the journey of the characters based on Tolkien's description (indeed, people have done that). And I like Tolkien's subtle humour!\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring", "user": "Tyas", "stars": "4", "date": "Sep 17, 08", "likes": "1"},

{"text": "\n           \n           I sometimes feel as if my reading of Lord of the Rings was somewhat tainted by watching the first two movies first, but I soon realize that comparing the two is like comparing peas and apples, as dear Bilbo says. I love the movies for the characterization, the settings, the grandiose feel. I love the books for the myths, the background stories, the poetry, the differences in the storyline, the way each sentence feels like a well written essay.That being said, I was around 14 or so when I first read The Fellowship of the Ring, and I immediately felt confused. It took me weeks to move past the first few chapters, of the hobbits in the Shire. I put it down, picked it back up, and then something, just around the Tom Bombadil chapter, hooked me and I kept on reading. I considered myself a 'smart' 14 year old, but the language threw me, and I had difficulty concentrating when everything was so flowery. But after that first read, and the sudden ending with the next book, I had to keep reading. I had to know what differences would crop up, and how it all ended, because Return of the King was not yet in cinemas.My experiences with this book have changed over the years; I've read this book at least five times since then. I've attempted quite a few 'difficult' novels, and learned the true novels that will forever haunt me as a confusing mash of language I was not made to understand (Tess of the D'Ubervilles, and anything by Charles Dickens are my own insurmountable Caradhras of the literary world)So what about this time around? It was like sinking into a pool of familiarity, and my love is as strong as ever. That 14 year old me grew to love language, and soon learned that there were people far more clever than her. But I never lost my love of this story, and the characters. I never tire of the beautiful songs in the books, the moral tone and the scenes of terrible battles. I know exactly what happens and when, but I still have strength to read on. If you let it, these books become a part of you the way only a good book can, an extension of your imagination. Good books let you into their world with ease. The Fellowship of the Ring is one of those books; an epic tale of friendship, war, honor and good vs evil.

{"text": "\n           \n           Funny how Tolkien seems to be taking this leisurely little story for a philological spin all the way until we hit the mines of Moria. Then things get AWESOME!Also, and sorry for dragging a movie comparison into a book review, but reading through again in the Post-LOTR-Movie-Era, I can't help noticing the interesting choices Jackson made, and the amazing way he truncates a hundred pages of toiling and lugubrious tale-telling into a blipping pixel of a scene. And also interesting how in the film, Boromir is less obnoxious and Aragorn is less sure of his Kingly role than in the books. And my little review can't contribute anything to the ocean of opinion out there, but I sure love these books-- they have been a perfect post-partum read: epic clashes of good and evil, triumph against all odds, loyalty and beauty and truth and loss... I heard that the post-partum hormones put you on a \"mythic\" plane-- where life does seem to be about God and the Devil, about Chaos and Redemption. Lord of the Rings sure navigates that cathartic journey beautifully.One more thought: I read the books sort of inside-out this time. Two Towers first, then Return of the King, then Fellowship of the Ring. I loved it and I think I'll always read them that way in the future. The momentum from the inspired drama of the last two propelled me through the ho-hum first 300 pages of Fellowship. :)\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Rebecca", "stars": "5", "date": "Apr 18, 10", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           REVIEW: I have always loved the tale of The Lord of the Rings. Back when the first movie was about to come out, my father gave me his copies of the books and told me that I should read them. Well, they were much too intimidating at such a young age for me, so I stuck with enjoying the story on the big screen. My family went to see every one, and I adored them.Now that I have finally had the chance to read the story for myself, I have to say I was not disappointed. I have heard things about the book being too much description and nonsense rather than actual story, and in some ways I can see where people have got that. There are a lot of confusing names and places, and I don't think I would have understood as much if I had not seen the movie first. With that being said though, I never really felt overwhelmed with information like I thought I would.I think that the book is actually better than the movie, which isn't really too much of a surprise because they usually are, but the LotR movies are pretty darn good so I was worried this may be an exception. I loved following the characters and getting to know them all so much better. I also loved getting to see a little bit more of the world, because while the movie was pretty accurate to the book, they did leave out some things like good ole Tom Bombadill and other details that really enhanced the story.The plot is amazing, and I can really understand why this series had such a huge nerd following. There are so many magical details involved, and for those of us that wish we lived in older times where magic was still believable and knights and princesses and dragons and elves all still existed there is no better place to explore than Middle Earth. I also read online that J.R.R. Tolkien originally told these tales to his children (more so The Hobbit than the darker tales of Frodo) and I am super jealous. These would have been amazing stories to hear and probably really sparked the imagination of his children.All in all, I will definitely be continuing with Frodo on his journey to save Middle Earth. And if you have been too intimidated to read this series, or have heard it is all scenery, please give it a chance for yourself because you may be surprised!FIRST LINE: \"When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.\"RATING BREAKDOWN: Plot: 20/20Characters: 20/20Writing: 20/20Creativity: 20/20Ending: 10/10The 'It' Factor: 10/10=100/100, A+ \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Jessica Saylor", "stars": "5", "date": "May 26, 12", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           Everybody's been a part of one of those discussions: Books that are better than the movie - or movies that are better than the book. There's certain books / movies that tend to turn up a lot in the latter category: The Shining, The Silence of the Lambs, sometimes old crap like Ben-Hur and Gone With the Wind, stuff that nobody REALLY cares about.I had one of these discussions recently around a campfire, and I did not mention The Fellowship of the Ring. I was too scared to say that the film was better than the book, even though I definitely think so.I dislike Tolkien for almost the very same reason I dislike Proust. Whereas Proust deals with the vast minutiae of reality, Tolkien deals with the vast minutiae of a completely made-up world. The funny thing is, I can actually relate to Tolkien's world (which, with its mythical creatures and heroic deeds, is clearly totally absurd and unrealistic) better than I can relate to Proust's agonizing over colors and slight breezes.My problem, however, is not with Middle Earth. It's those damn DETAILS! It's like Tolkien feared that the main questions his readers will have on their minds while they read his books are things like \"Well what was the name of the homeland of that dwarf that he just briefly referenced? And what are the names of the dwarf's kinsmen? And THEIR kinsmen?\" or, \"He described how that river sounds, smells, feels, tastes, and looks... But what is it thinking about right now?\" or, \"Remind me for a third time, please: What were the names, locations, and foreign diplomacy histories of all of eleven Hobbit villages?\"The nice thing about a film is that it doesn't have any of this stuff. Oh, don't think that the insufferable nerds who make those things wouldn't put these details in, if they could! Luckily, common decency doesn't allow for that sort of thing. Don't get me wrong: I'm equally in favor of both film and literature. I don't put one above the other. (I realize that, this site being about books, many people here would put literature first; well, those people are dicks.) Anyway, to make a long story short, that's why the film of Fellowship is better than the book.While Tolkien was busy figuring out the ludicrously intricate histories of every single species in Middle Earth (and not just the anthropomorphs - if there are termites in Middle Earth, I'm sure they'll get their fifteen pages of fame. I haven't read the second or third books yet) - anyway, while Tolkien was busy with this, he forgot to give his characters stuff like emotions, depth, and personality. They HAVE emotions, of course: Tolkien mentions that they do. Why wouldn't they? Everybody has 'em! But Tolkien didn't actually GIVE them those emotions; as in, write about the emotions, and make it seem real. As far as personality goes, Gandalf, Sam, and Frodo's evil relatives are the only characters who seem to have any. The rest are interchangeable. Hobbits don't act differently from other hobbits; elves from other elves. Tom Bombadil might be worth mentioning, if he weren't horrible, and awful, and excruciatingly annoying, and by far the worst character in the book.Still, the trilogy that Fellowship begins is considered an all-time great for a reason. Its world is compelling for the same reason that the genre it helped create is compelling: We like to read about magic, strange creatures, epic battles, heroes and villains, and other such nonsense. It's escapism. It's not a naughty word; Tolkien even uses it in his introduction.I don't think my views on Tolkien are unfair. From what little I've read of the fantasy genre, there seems to be a lot of the same fictional histories that irked me so much in Tolkien: descendants; ancient battles; powerful but extinct forces; all that ponderous, meaningless stuff that some people apparently go nuts for. However, not every author forgets to give his story some substance and emotion in the meantime. For that, Tolkien had no excuse; he was just a bad writer.(Oh yeah, one more thing: The songs. I hate them. I hate them, so, SO much. I think the thing I hate about them the most is that for some reason,  It would save me SO much time, since about 10% of the book is composed of songs; but I just can't do it. I have this irrational fear of skipping stuff, as if it will ruin the entire book for me, or like I'll be stripped of any right to say that I've \"read\" it.)\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Sosen", "stars": "2", "date": "Jun 09, 13", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           \"One Ring to rule them all,One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them alland in the darkness bind them.\"In this first book of the Lord of the Rings, Tolkien begins one of the the most acclaimed stories of modern day literature. As readers, we see Frodo taken out of his hum drum Hobbit life and brought into a world of warriors, wizards, and water horses. Throughout the story Frodo begins his transformation into the brave \"chosen one\" that he must become if he is to defeat the evil lord Sauron.Though it may be slowly paced at first, the Fellowship will draw you into not only the story but the characters, and give you a reason to never close the cover. An important theme to be noted is Free Will vs. Control, a battle that Frodo continues to face as the ring he has sworn to destroy is trying to take him over. And in one moment, \"Frodo, neither the Voice nor the Eye: free to choose, and with one remaining instant in which to do so. He took the Ring off his finger.\" This is only the beginning to a wonderfully crafted story by J. R. R. Tolkien. Even if you have seen all three movies, there is an experience within these pages that you simply could not receive. So sit down, crack open the book, and follow Frodo on his magic journey. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Zach", "stars": "5", "date": "Feb 03, 13", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           ** spoiler alert **\n           \u201cReading is the sole means by which we slip, involuntarily, often helplessly, into another\u2019s skin, another\u2019s voice, and another\u2019s soul.\" This valid quote by Carol Oates portrays the emotional ties that readers often inevitably develop when reading an intriguing story. Enjoyment when reading can usually be enhanced when reading fiction. Fiction has been a tool used to take someone from the cares of everyday life and bring them into a world of fantasy and adventure. Because of this, J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s book Fellowship of the Ring is a perfect depiction of all that a fiction book should strive to be as enjoyable as. Fellowship of the Ring is a captivating book due to its wonderfully lovable and developed characters, the symbolism, and the intensity of the storyline.\tFellowship of the Ring is filled with several golden characters that are lovable and developed well throughout the book. At the Council of Elrond, Frodo says \u201c\u2018I will take the Ring, though I do not know the way\u2019\u201d (Tolkien 270). This line from Frodo Baggins shows his willingness and humility that makes him such a brave and likable character. He is a relatable hobbit who is open minded. He strives to do all that he can, and has admirable perseverance and drive. The wizard Gandalf the Grey explains to Frodo, \u201cMany that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends\u201d (Tolkien 69). Gandalf is always full of knowledge and continuously imparts his wisdom and enlightening the other characters to new mindsets. These two characters along with the kindred Sam Gamgee and many others are consistent in their portrayed personalities throughout the book, yet learning a few altering lessons as the story progresses. Towards the end of the book after Sam insisted on continuing on the treacherous journey with Frodo, Frodo said, \u201cIt\u2019s no good trying to escape you. But I am glad, Sam. I cannot tell you how glad. Come along! It is plain that we were meant to go together\u201d (Tolkien 423). This response from Frodo shows how he develops as a character into having a new level of gratitude and determination. The relatability of these characters produced a fantasy that was simultaneously relevant and filled with symbolism to the real world.This novel is filled with symbolism that made it relatable and easy to connect to. After being drawn by the pull of the ring into anger towards Gandalf who was trying to convince Bilbo to leave the ring behind, Bilbo said \u201cI am sorry, but I felt so queer. And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any more. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was like an eye looking at me\u201d (Tolkien 43). The concept of the ring throughout this book is symbolic of everything evil in the world. It shows that it can be tempting to hold onto and tend to pull humanity into it, sometimes so strongly that it\u2019s against their own will to do right. Regardless, it is always corrupting no matter what the initial motives for it are. It is both desired and despised by those who encounter it. This quote also shows that in the end it is liberating to let go of because of its invasive and controlling powers. Shortly after seeing Bilbo for the first time in a long time, Frodo realized that Bilbo was already pursuing the ring. After Frodo rejects Bilbo the ring Tolkien writes \u201cTo his distress and amazement he found that he was no longer looking at Bilbo; a shadow seemed to have fallen between them, and through it he found himself eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and boney groping hands. He felt a desire to strike him \u201d (Tolkien 244). This quote shows the effects that the ring has on its handlers, symbolizing the effects that evil has on people who meddle in it. It gives a visualization of the transformation of people that occurs due to it that makes them essentially lose their own identity. Frodo\u2019s burdenful quest of carrying the ring to Mordor and losing trust in some of his friends is what really adds to the intensity of the storyline. Fellowship of the Ring is filled with intense scenes that make it difficult at times to set down. With Black Riders, Orcs, and all the powers of Mordor combined in constant search of Frodo, the excitement is inevitable. In a desperate situation where Frodo puts the ring on his finger to escape his enemies, and unintentionally make himself more susceptible to the ring\u2019s power, Tolkien writes \u201cImmediately, though everything else remained as before, dim and dark, the shapes became terribly clear. He was able to see beneath their black trappings. There were five tall figures: two standing on the lip of the dell, three advancing. In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; under their mantles were long grey robes, upon their grey hairs were helms of silver; in their haggard hands were swords of steel\u201d (Tolkien 208). This quote gives a description of a moment for Frodo Baggins being able to see into the realm that the ring brings him into, and see the Black Riders under their facades. This is an extremely intense moment in the reading. What started out for Frodo as trying to escape the Black Riders turned into a near death experience where he was stabbed in the shoulder by a Rider. This is a riveting moment written in a captivating way. In another intense moment where Boromir had fallen into the ring\u2019s power and momentarily turned on Frodo, Frodo put the ring on to hide from him. After escaping Boromir, Frodo endures the effects of the ring \u201cThen as another flash from some other point of power there came to his mind another thought: Take it off! Take it off! Fool, take it off! Take off the Ring\u201d (Tolkien 417). This moment adds to the intensity by showing the internal battle that the ring produces in its bearers. This creates empathy for Frodo\u2019s tribulations. The way in which the intensity of this story draws the reader in and causes them to continuously read to find out what happens next is a big part of what essentially makes this novel such an enjoyable read. The amazing characters and symbolism found in the intense storyline altogether produced a remarkable novel. As the characters endured difficult times and heart warming moments, the strings of the heart are pulled in all kinds of directions in a way that creates an emotional connection to the reading. Through the symbolism, the reader is able to personally relate. If the meaningful lessons of life and faithful friendship that Tolkien uses in this novel were applied to real life, the world would all around be a better place where when united in true friendship, one could persevere through anything. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Kailey", "stars": "5", "date": "Nov 19, 13", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           Well, the second time through this book was not what I remembered (I am always intrigued by what one gains from a book on the second read and at an older age). I enjoyed it, but it was slow moving at times. There were many things I did still like about the story though. The journey through the mines of Moria is still one of my favorite (intense) moments. With each beat of the orcs' drum I got chills down my spine. I still have a soft spot for Gollum and I still wish poor Frodo didn't have to carry such a heavy load. Tolkien creates such a beautiful image of every land visited through his descriptive imagination. While it can be a bit much at times, without it we would not be able to capture and behold such a beautiful picture in our minds. The imagery created in the chapters relating to the Elvish lands are stunning. I wish I could get lost in a place like Rivendale or Lorien. But there is so much more than imagery in this story.The characters in the Fellowship contain such an amazing loyalty for each other. I am take aback by it every time I read the books or watch the movies. Sam, Merry, and Pippin's care and friendship with Frodo is touching. Frodo is carrying the weight of evil on his shoulders and they refuse to let him go through it alone, no matter where the road may lead them. The friendship we get to watch unfold between Gimli and Legolas is one of my favorites. The most unlikely of friends find a respect and allegiance for one another in the midst of history and old grudges. There is so much one can learn about friendship, alone, from this book.

{"text": "\n           \n           I must admit, I had my reservations about this book. I'm a dork and a half for the movies and have been for nearly ten years now (they came out when I was thirteen). I saw all of them in theaters at least twice when they came out; I went to the midnight viewings for the second and third ones. I own the extended edition DVDs. I've watched the freaking , for crying out loud. I have no problems admitting my dorkiness when it comes to the Lord of the Rings movies.The books, however...eek. I tried to read  after the first movie was released and put it down in disgust after about three pages. The history of hobbits (and their pipe weed, of all things) didn't interest me in the slightest. It didn't look as though the books would have even a modicum of the humor, action, and adventure that the movies did. Plus the books aren't helped by the ever-present, painfully pretty to look upon Orlando Bloom. I put them into my \"books that aren't as good as their movies\" pile (a tiny stack indeed) and moved on.I'm glad I gave these another shot. I knew I was ready when I was watching the movies for the umpteenth time on TV this past week and found myself dashing to the computer to Wikipedia some inane piece of trivia the movies don't reveal but that Tolkien surely covered in one of his many appendices. I wanted to know more about Ents, hobbits, the Dunedain, and where Legolas buys his shampoo.The books are tedious at times, I'll grant you. There is an awful lot of walking, as I was warned, and the characters tend to cry things out (\"To Mordor!\" Frodo cried, for example) which usually drives me batty. But I was pleasantly surprised that a good deal of the humor from the movies wasn't just Peter Jackson's reckoning. Tolkien himself was undeniably humorous, the sly old fox, although this is coming from someone who giggles to herself while reading Shakespeare and Charles Dickens.So anyway. Final verdict: very much worth the effort, made me laugh, and I always looked forward to reading it.

{"text": "\n           \n           This is my favorite of the Lord of the Rings books, mostly because of the skill with which Tolkien sets up the contrast between Frodo's peaceful home life and the gathering threat that eventually forces him away from it. The threat is palpable and as believable as you could ever hope for orcs and wizards and the undead to be.The most impressive aspect of the novel (and the trilogy in general) is the sheer richness of the fantasy world in which it takes place. Tolkien was confident enough and bold enough to have created a variety of cultures, mythologies, geographies, and histories that feel fully developed, but yet are only hinted at in the course of the books. The rest of it is left unused, but Middle-Earth feels real because of it.Ironically, even though this novel takes place closer to \"home\" than the other two, or perhaps because of that fact, Middle-Earth feels bigger here. There is a powerful sense that the hobbits, and the story, could go anywhere, and it's a delight to re-experience that, even though I've read the series multiple times and know exactly what's going to happen.The only real distraction is the whole Tom Bombadil episode, which just doesn't fit.

{"text": "\n           ** spoiler alert **\n           I chose this book because the series seemed interesting and it was on my Nook. The book is about The Fellowship of the Ring, a group of creatures who are set out to destroy an evil ring, which, when reunited with it's master, could cause horrible destruction of almost everything in their world. These creatures include hobbits, two men, an elf, a wizard, and a dwarf who are trying to destroy the One Ring and ultimately, defeat the dark lord Sauron. My favorite quote from the book was, \"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them,\" because it illustrated how if the Ring returned to Sauron all that was good in Middle Earth, the setting of the book, would end. Tolkien's writing style was the one weakness I saw in this otherwise amazing book. He was constantly writing about minor details and this caused the dull parts of the story to just drag on and on for ages. One part of the story was about a forest called Lorien and to be honest I felt like skipping the 100 pages about a tree to get back into the action. The part with Merry and Pippin being kidnapped could have been better explained, but sadly that was when Tolkien stopped going into every single detail about Middle Earth that ever existed. The point of view was good in this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who watched The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings movies.

How I look forward to meeting you in Heaven and having a long discussion about how you created the brilliant \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d series. \u201cThe Fellowship of the Ring,\u201d is a literary masterpiece, in my opinion. Tolkien not only created an entire fictional world, but also a language to go with it! The development of Tolkien\u2019s characters have always impressed and inspired me. He has a way of making them come to life on the page. Tolkien is a master of character relationships; the way they interact and speak with each other seems so realistic. The description of action and location is so vivid and easy to picture; as I read, the story plays through my mind. The story also has a great balance between action and detail, it\u2019s not so packed with drama that the plot becomes lost, but it is also not overly wordy. Tolkien chooses his language carefully and everything seems to fit together for the good of the story. He also succeeded in creating characters that readers can immediately relate to and root for. Frodo Baggins is not a super-hero, filled with bravery and sharp instinct. He is a hobbit. He is small, reserved, not well-traveled, and vulnerable to temptation. But Frodo has a good heart and a strong spirit and that is ultimately what carries him through his journey, that and the help of his friends. To me, character is one of the most important aspects of a good story. The plot may be brilliant, but if the characters aren\u2019t ones that I care about, it doesn\u2019t really matter.

This is one of the books that defined the whole epic fantasy genre!Most people I asked prior to reading it had the notion that this was a boring book, but I was very surprised to find myself so immersed in the gargantuan world that Tolkien created for us. The depth of the Middle-earth that he has created I find staggering (in a good way), from the places, races, characters and so on. Also, being a mountaineer, it was quite a pleasure for me to read some elaborate parts of the Company's seemingly endless expeditions on forest, mountains and caves, both those are presented with such evil and darkness (ex: Mordor, Gondor), as well as those in the paradise spectrum side (ex: Lothlorien, Rivendell). Although I have to admit, some of the parts I did not give too much attention to since it was difficult for me (like when Tolkien starts to describe in detail what's in the west, north, south, etc.), and I didn't think it would give much bearing to my overall understanding of the story.I have only finished TFotR so far, but I am already looking forward to reading TTT and TRotK.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Ni\u00f1o", "stars": "5", "date": "Aug 12, 12", "likes": "1"},

{"text": "\n           \n           Some books can just stay with people in an entire lifetime, and The Fellowship of the Ring is just one of those books. When reading this book the reader is thrown into a magical world with both the darkest evils and the brightest forces for good. The Fellowship of the Ring is jam packed with adventure, danger, and all around fun. Anyone who wants a book that is incredibly hard to put down, this book is the one. JRR Tolkien was a magnificent author and most of his books live down for generation to generation. The Fellowship of the Ring was a magnificent book because of the never lacking courage in the face of adventure, strong friendships, and its wonderful fantasy world.Throughout the entire book Frodo and company always go from \u201cout of the frying pan then into the fire\u201d. Adventure and danger seem to follow them like a fly to candy. Tolkien writes, \u201cThere is a seed of courage hidden (often deeply, it is true) in the heart of the fattest and most timid hobbit, waiting for some final and desperate danger to make it grow\u201d (Tolkien 137). This quote is an example of the courage that the small hobbits of the Shire have. Even though their journey is never lacking in danger and adventure, they have more courage than the average man. From the Black riders, to Orks, to just perilous landscapes they do not get rest. The danger level rises throughout the book. It started with them just running from unfamiliar riders to fighting one of the mighty Bolrog. The theme with this danger that is shone from beginning to end is that ignorance is bliss. The more someone knows about the danger around them more dangerous it is. For example when Frodo was stabbed in the shoulder with the Black Rider\u2019s blade, he had no idea that it was really turning him into a slave for the riders. Instead he trudged on thinking he had a mere stab wound. Frodo even admitted that if he knew the damage that was being done to him he would have never been able to take a step. One that is known for sure is that if Frodo did not have his wonderful friends to help him along he would have never made it out of the Shire. Fellowship is a key word in the book. The friendships that occur in the book are all for life. Each member of the Fellowship has undying love and loyalty to each of the other members of the company. For example, Frodo and Sam\u2019s relationship is stronger than diamonds. Tolkien writes, \u201cSam is a fine fellow and would follow you down a dragon's throat if he didn't trip over his feet first\u201d (Tolkien 102). These words that Merry speaks to Frodo, show just what Sam would do to keep his master and best friend safe. Sam is Frodo\u2019s rock; he is what keeps him from going to the dark side. Sam\u2019s pure love and loyalty keeps Frodo on his path to destroy the ring. Another relationship that is stronger than bricks would be the bond between Gimli and Legolas. One might expect that they would be enemies due to the long standing feud between the two races. In the beginning of the book they are definitely not friends, but as the book goes on their friendship steadily grows. Out of the hatred that the Elves and Dwarves have, blossomed an everlasting friendship. Tolkien\u2019s pure, complete, and utter genius in the story line most definitely carries on to the setting of the story. The fantasy world that Tolkien created lives down in history as one of the best in all time. His detail is just sublime. Impressively, the man created his own language. If someone wanted to they could learn Elfish. The detail he put in to the surroundings are marvelous. For example, the Forest of Lothl\u00f3rien is the grandest of all elfish forests. Tolkien explains the beauty of this forest to the color of the bark. When describing the forest, Tolkien writes, \u201cIn the dim light of the stars their stems were grey, and their quivering leaves a hint of fallow gold\u201d (Tolkien 328). This is just one of the many times that Tolkien describes this beautiful fantasy world in magnificent detail. Another thing that makes Middle Earth one of the best would all of the creatures that dwell in it. The creativity must have gone into inventing his own species was most likely quite a bit. The number of species that co inside with each other in middle earth is a great number, and each of them are described in some way in great detail.The wonderful writing, strong characters, wonderful world of fantasy, adventure, and strong friendships all made this story the magnificent bestseller it was. So many books are ok, but what makes The Fellowship of the Ring stand out from the crowd would for sure be the detailed fantasy world. This book is an escape from the real world into a beautiful world of magic, creatures, and adventure. The morals that this book showed he world, such as the idea that with enough good one can always trump evil.

{"text": "\n           \n           A beautifully written, classic legend. It's hard-going but it's worth it.I first attempted to read this book when I was 10. Unfortunately, I thought it was all going to be written like the Prologue, which is, as it says, a summary of 'The Hobbit' and immediately decided not to bother. When I flicked through as a last-ditch attempt, I stumbled upon a section that amounted to pages and pages about the surroundings and the local flora. That was that; I read 'Harry Potter' instead. Recently, though, I discovered my long-forgotten, decade-old set of the trilogy and decided to give it a go. After painstakingly trudging through that old prologue, which brought back memories of dread (I was forbidden to skip it by my brother, who is reading them at the same time - his own illustrated boxed set, of course), I loved it instantly. I realised that the reason I didn't like it in the first place was because I didn't get what it was. This isn't a fantasy romp; it's Tolkien's attempt to record another people's entire mythology - as if he were one of those people. 'Harry Potter', an excellent achievement and a series I much enjoyed, pales in comparison, and not because of the obvious similarities (ranging from the concept of a Dark Lord to the fact that the word 'squib', seemingly peculiar to 'Harry Potter', appeared in the very first chapter of this book) but because if Tolkien had written 'Harry Potter', then squibs would have a backstory as detailed as Harry's; every single book or history event mentioned by the characters would be written out - it would exist, as more than just a statement to show that there are history events somewhere; true maps of the entire Hogwarts building would actually be available, not to mention the exact route of the Hogwarts Express. That's how 'The Lord of the Rings' reads, having read its successor first. Next to LOTR, HP's best quality - the fact that you can imagine being a wizard too - is a failing, because I didn't feel like I was from Middle Earth; I felt like I was being shown it in the utmost detail, and that turns out to be better. In what Tolkien set out to do, he has definitely succeeded. I believe Tolkien said once in a lecture that dead languages are those that do not have legends attached to them, idioms and such like. This is why he gave the Elves, Dwarves and Orcs their own languages (the Elves even get their own equivalent of Latin) - it isn't for show, or to increase the reader's sense of immersion in fantasy. It's because these are peoples and to accompany their cultures, they need their own language, of course! It is incredible to read some of the poems and inscriptions, or even just speech; Tolkien's learned imagination is breathed into every page. But he didn't just do it because he could, either (even though he was probably, justifiably, proud of his invented languages). A beautiful scene where Frodo witnesses Aragorn speaking to an absent companion in Elvish would not have worked if the Elvish speech wasn't actually written out. The authentic feeling of hearing someone speak in a language that you don't understand, and trying to work it out by gesture, is fully recreated, both through Frodo's eyes and the reader's. I love languages, so I'd be happy with languages there for their own sake, but  a linguist, I appreciate even more keenly the fact that the information is there but I don't understand it.Everyone from the heroes Aragorn and Frodo to random horsemen met on the way gets his own family tree. 'What's the need?!' you might ask - but again, this is imitative of mythology. Anyone who has read Homer's 'Iliad' must have groaned in frustration and boredom at the long lists of warriors and their lineage and provenance - it's especially awful in Greek, where half the time, it says 'this one [previously mentioned] struck X, son of Y, while that one [i.e. X] struck him back, then Z came and struck them both' - but boring as they are (more boring than anything in Tolkien), no one questions why they're there. The 'Iliad' is a record of a myth as well as a story. I use the 'Iliad' because I studied it and I'm familiar with the common features, but I'm sure Tolkien's own area of expertise - Old Anglo-Saxon/Norse mythology - has very similar features in its literature. The reason this seems out of place in Tolkien is perhaps because Tolkien's work is prose, but it still works, and you get the impression that every character IS a person, just as every soldier who died in the 'Iliad' died for something.What of Tolkien's prose, then? Even where the subject matter is boring, you never once get the idea that Tolkien himself loses interest. He can see these places and he describes them vividly (so vividly that you can buy a detailed atlas to follow along with the journey), and his descriptions are beautiful. I've noticed that he rarely uses metaphor, preferring to state things as they are, but his writing is still very varied. Its syntax carries an extremely quaint charm that fits with the stubbornly old-fashioned semantics. He doesn't appear to like delving deeply into characters' minds, either. There is no stream of conscious (not in this book at least - I haven't got to the other two yet), even though much of the book could be said to be from Frodo's point of view. He states thoughts, again, in a manner that recalls ancient literature. Either it's simply 'Frodo was worried because/that...' or he relays the thought in the manner of direct speech. It's a very traditional way of telling a story, but the emotions are clear for those who want to know them, and the absence of long internal monologues is appropriate to the type of story it is. In fact, it's just as well that they're absent, as otherwise the pace would be unbearably slow (that is, it is slow now, but if we paused to hear Frodo's thoughts at every point, the book would never end). I find Tolkien like Virgil (a Roman farmer who wrote nature poetry before turning to a war song that became the national epic) in that his most beautiful prose describes the landscapes, not quick actions like battles. One or two war-related scenes seemed quite stilted, and important character events are described in two paragraphs simply because that is all that happened - he doesn't expand like you would have to expand with a vivid description of everything that appears along one footpath, for example - and the other characters' reactions are limited to a brief note on who was weeping and who wasn't. I'll be interested to see what the bigger battles in the next books are like. But in this book, I found that, while these scenes may seem weak on their own, and contrary to what we would imagine as an epic war fantasy, they fit extremely well into the work as a whole. Despite the lack of elaboration on characters' feelings, their personalities are extremely clear and well drawn. For all his verbosity, Tolkien is a much better practitioner of 'do rather than tell' than he seems when you first read his straightforward statements of what someone was thinking. Those absent streams of consciousness are there, if you want them.A note on the moralistic aspect. People have remarked upon Catholic symbology in Tolkien's work, and its stuffy morality. This is usually meant as a criticism. I actually  Catholic, and similar-minded to Tolkien, so I find those same qualities admirable. But in any case I really don't find that it hit me in the face. Normally if I notice overt Christian symbolism, I either roll my eyes or smile knowingly, but here it wasn't obvious at all. One example is the fact that the Eye of Sauron is described as containing 'nothing' which is the orthodox Catholic description of evil, but I only noticed that because Wikipedia pointed it out. It's not like, say, 'The Chronicles of Narnia' where it  hit you in the face (I haven't even read them and I can smell it a mile off). Equally, it's no criticism to say that evil and good seem to be external agents (as someone did below), it isn't even relevant - it just misses the point. One requires only the basic skill of reading to judge someone's character on their responses to external incarnations of evil. Think again of the 'Iliad'; there's a famous scene where Athena (goddess of wisdom) grabs Achilles by the hair to stop him doing something rash - is that Athena the character? does Achilles have no brains of his own? Or actually, does Athena represent both the goddess of wisdom  wisdom itself? It's easy if you read it as a myth and not a fantasy story. I haven't found the first book overly moralising in any way. I've seen vague accusations of conservative morals. Firstly, like I said, I wouldn't actually have a problem with overly conservative morals. So Aragorn lives with Arwen as an inspiration, and we see him reminiscing over their declaration of love instead of burning with desire for her when the Fellowship is camping at night - isn't that a  thing? Some things are better left to the imagination of those who want to imagine them, and what Tolkien  choose to show us is just what he intended: an inspiration. They are a couple from myth. But secondly, moreover, I don't actually find this overly moralising or overly conservative or any combination. Tolkien doesn't imply that Aragorn doesn't, or even shouldn't, lie there burning with desire for Arwen when they're camping. He merely shows the principles he intends for people to . 'Applicability, not allegory', he apparently strove to achieve, and though when I read that, I didn't know what the difference was, I've seen it and it makes for a totally different reading experience. One final point for any sceptics.  is as un-Catholic a thing to do as you can possibly get. I think anyone who sees a superfluous amount of Catholic symbolism in these books (well, this one, anyway) is looking for it in order to preach about it (for or against it, in exactly the same manner) and has missed the point. Christianity is a mythology, like all of the others Tolkien used; this is not a veiled gospel, not in the slightest. Unlike Tolkien, I do like allegory as well; but this wouldn't work as allegory. It's a record of a different people, not a reflection of different tendencies of existing peoples, and the achievement should be taken that way. For those who don't like the genre, I find that Tolkien leaves more to the imagination than any author who relies on subtext. I strain to work out what characters are thinking - because I know that Tolkien intends them to be thinking of a specific thing - rather than imposing on them what I'd think if I were them, and that's challenging, enjoyable and inspiring as he intended it to be. Just as the ambivalent Homer was the forefather of tragedians who did expound on characters' feelings, the restrained, meticulous and learned Tolkien is the perfect forefather of epic fantasy.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Olivia", "stars": "5", "date": "Aug 31, 12", "likes": "1"},

Both of these turned out to be false, I rather like both the characters and the writing style.Tolkien is great at building up the tension during the story's progression, and I often had the urge to look over my shoulder during parts where the characters were pursued or in eminent danger. However the moments where the tension should culminate, in fights and encounters, in my opinion Tolkien \"fails to deliver\". Combat or serious problems are often resolved by a single sword stroke or spell, or simply running away. Because these are often the moments chosen to be depicted in the film, I had expectations of these situations that were not lived up to. I can live with this, though, since the rest of the story is great. As for the rest, Tolkien managed to create a very diverse world, as we all know. Middle-Earth truly came alive for me, and I can still, even without the pages of the book in front of me, easily picture myself venturing through the lands described by Tolkien.

However, and it is a big however, there is a reason why this book is, beyond all doubt, a great classic - the immense skill and talent of Tolkien in telling a story. I read a lot, ask my family, my nose is never out of a book, has been since I was a young child, and in all my years of reading (coming up to 20, even if the first few were just Spot the Dog books!) I have yet to actually encounter an author who tells a story so well. It flows like a story told verbally, only it isn't, it's written, and how he managed it I will always be wondering at. The tale of the Ring is woven like the legends of old passed down from father to son at the coming of age, and I found myself often wondering if this really had happened (it didn't help that I stumbled upon an article that insinuated Hobbits actually existed at the same time I was reading). The highest praise is given for the way the story develops, and I am looking forward to reading more of their journey, however I am slightly hopeful that it has a tadge less detail as it is rather hard to keep track of what appears to be, at the moment anyway, some irrelevant names and tales that confuse me! I've never had a head for names so I'm getting my Sauron's mixed up with my Saruman's and my Moria's with my Mordors, to mention but a few!I can highly recommend this book, however hard to follow it can be at times. The characters are edgy, easy to like or dislike, or even feel indifferent about - Boromir comes to mind here, but they are also easy to connect and invest emotion in. It's strange to feel emotionally invested in a character in a book, especially when you're not far in, but there is something about little Frodo (no pun intended!) that is just so cute and easy to like, but even better is his development as a character and individual throughout the book. Even the passing characters demand some kind of connection with the reader, perhaps the most endearing of these is good old Tom Bombadil, a character that oozes life and virility in such abundance it's a wonder he doesn't pop out the page and start singing his tales of yore. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that, as one who for years insisted I didn't like these books, I'm a convert, but I can see why I had such reservations. The only difference is that as a more mature and experienced reader, I can overlook those matters and see to the story as a whole, which is, most definitely, one of the greatest stories ever told.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings #1)", "user": "Lily Loves Indie", "stars": "5", "date": "Aug 28, 13", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           Reviewing this book won't be easy for me, so I'm going to take a less conventional approach. I have lost track of how many times I've read this and how many times I will read it in the future, so I've decided to write a new response each time I read it. It'll be an ever growing review.Reading finished Nov. 28th, 2013Galadriel stood out to me this time like she never has before. I have a feeling it's because I read  right before reading . What wonders reading for the big picture can do. When I think about where Galadriel has come from in  to where she is in this book, I can see that she is greater and more real than I had ever realized before. For those of you who have not yet read  this will be harder to understand, but I'll try to summarize it as succinctly as possible. Galadriel came to Middle-earth because she wanted to rule her own realm--she wanted to be a queen of Middle-earth. During the long years of her sojourn in Beleriand and Middle-earth, she became wiser and more humble, yet she did not ever wholly relinquish her secret desire until Frodo offered her the ring. Long had she desired it and thought of how she might use it to establish her realm. But when the moment of truth came and Galadriel was offered a choice between the fulfillment of her long desire or the fading of rejecting this hidden evil, she made the right choice. She made a decision based not on her own desires but on what was best for all the free peoples who opposed the evil of Sauron. For this, Galadriel is truly great. And even though Galadriel stood out to me in this reading, many of the characters in this book make the right choices for the same reasons. They do what is right because it is right and because it is what is best for everyone. Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Sam--the list could go on. Their altruism is part of what makes this story so enduring and so encouraging.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Ethan", "stars": "5", "date": "Dec 08, 13", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           Simply extraordinary. A 5-star rating is not enough!I've been a fan of Sam, Frodo, Gandalf and the rest of the Company for as long as I can remember. I grew up watching The Lord of the Rings films, and honestly, I've always preferred The Lord of the Rings to Harry Potter. (Although I'm also a huge Potterhead, okay. Hahaha.) I'm more than ecstatic to finally have the opportunity to read the actual series. In the end, I found it impossible to choose which is better-the book or the movie, because both had unique elements that really electrified J.R.R Tolkien's fictional masterpiece.The prologue of  already got me hooked. I enjoyed recalling what transpired from the prequel novel-, and at the same time, knowing more about the history of the Middle-earth, including the history of the Shire and the history of hobbits themselves. My interest grew even more as I read the next first chapters of the novel. I felt like I was meeting Bilbo and Frodo and Gandalf for the second time, and also knowing more about their characters. In the first chapters, I loved seeing the close relationship of Frodo and Bilbo more. Samwise Gamgee's character also caught my interest from the beginning chapters. Sam's character was one of my top favorite characters from the entire film series, and I loved reading about his humble start as a gardener. As the journey of the hobbits began, I was amazed by how the 3/4-hour long movie version of the book actually did not fully capture how tedious and weary the journey already was from the very beginning. Every chapter takes the readers along with Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin in their long and dangerous journey. I somehow also felt the length of each hour of their journey in the forest. The beginning of the novel showed nothing short of the courage that the four Hobbits of the Shire had as they dealt with the pursuit of dangerous Ringwraiths. One of the characters in the novel that didn't make it to the movie was Tom Bombadil, and I enjoyed meeting his character for the first time in the novel. The chapter, \"In the House of Tom Bombadil\", was definitely an enjoyable read, and I guess it would've been nice if he made it to the movie since his aid really came through to the hobbits in the novel. Also, the introduction of Strider's character was executed well. His character entered the story with such mystery and I loved how he came off as someone who's seemingly trustworthy- and even with Sam's skepticism, I found his character truly knowledgeable and easily likeable. One of my favorite parts in the (The Fellowship of the Ring) film was Arwen's saving of Frodo when he was struck by one of the Ringwraiths. So when I began reading that part in the novel-and realized it was a different character that got introduced during that part instead of Arwen-I was a bit dismayed. (Arwen was really one of my favorite characters from the films, along with Sam.) Although after reading that part in the novel, I found myself also liking the actual character that helped Frodo- Glorfindel. The thrill continued during the second part of the novel when Strider and the Hobbits finally arrived in Rivendell. I definitely enjoyed the chapter, \"The Council of Elrond\" since it was more information-packed and also full of stories. The movie version of that chapter was way shorter, and although it was also a great scene in the movie, I definitely enjoyed reading the actual longer version of it in the novel. The last 150 pages of the novel was still as packed as the first 300 pages of the novel. With the addition of Legolas and Gimli, the novel definitely escalated from there. The Company's journey through the Mines of Moria was very detailed and graphic, and the more or less two chapters dedicated to their journey through the Mines of Moria definitely showed the difficulty and misfortune that took place during the Company's time there. The journey to Lothlorien was also as exciting as the journey through the Mines of Moria. I enjoyed reading new scenes that were not familiar to me since they weren't shown in the movie. Much like the past chapters, the chapters that were dedicated to the Company's stay in Lothlorien was very vivid and full of life. As the book neared the end, I was already too excited to jump to the second book. And after finally finishing the first book, I felt overwhelmed by the length of it, in a positive way. Every scene in the movie was lengthened in the novel, and it was an amazing experience reading through it. I loved every part of the novel that wasn't shown in the movie, since it was very refreshing and each page perfectly gave way for readers to capture J.R.R Tolkien's imagined world. At the same time, I enjoyed reading the the actual version of the parts that made it into the movie. The movie adaptation was so superb and it definitely made some parts of the novel more enjoyable to read, since I can already picture it in my head, based on what I saw on film.What I've written in this review is definitely not enough to transcend how amazing the novel was. A must-read. If you've seen and loved The Fellowship of the Ring movie, then you're definitely in for a ride with the original novel version.

{"text": "\n           \n           \"The Fellowship of The Ring\" was a great read filled with an alarming amount of mystery and magic. \"The Fellowship of The Ring\" was the first installment of the single three part book known as the Lord of The Rings.The book starts out as a prologue that explains all the creatures and things that live in middle earth. it tells tales of Dwarves, Elves, Hobbits, Wizards, and even a dragon or two. This book is a true description of the fantasy genre that it lives in. With new creatures and myths to be told. It'll have you guessing what will happen at every corner. After the prologue is finished in its tales we pick up several years after the prior book. We learn that Bilbo Baggins is turning 111 years of age. Which to the hobbits was a very curios number. Bilbo had adopted a nephew of his, Frodo, whose parents had died several years before and Bilbo needed an heir.Gandalf ,the wizard, was a good friend to Bilbo in his last adventure and was visiting so he could see his good friend and wish him another happy year. Bilbo and Frodo shared a single birthday so a large celebration was thrown for the both of them, but as the party reached its climax Bilbo pulls of the disappearing act and vanishes before everyone's eyes. Frodo is now left to inherit all of Bilbo's fortune even his magical ring, that Gandalf had advised Frodo never to use. Frodo then feels that he is no longer welcome in his home the shire so he sells it to a distant cousin and sets out on his adventure with Sam, Pippin, and Merry. Gandalf will join him on their way. Many troubles are put against this traveling group. Such as Gandalf not joining them and a mysterious group of black riders that seem to be following the group where ever they go. I can't go into to much more detail in fear of gibing the story away but I can say that their are even more recognized characters in this story(if you've watched the movies),or if you've just heard a lot, and much more mystery, drama, and of course fantasy. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Brett", "stars": "3", "date": "Nov 01, 12", "likes": "1"},

The book begins in the Shire as the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins prepares for and celebrates his enormous 111th birthday party. This also introduces Frodo, a relative of Bilbo's and his heir. All is relatively normal, until Bilbo vanishes in front of hundreds of hobbits. All this sets of a chain of events in which Frodo finds himself inheriting Bilbo's estate until being tasked by the wizard Gandalf to complete a quest of utter importance. Frodo must take the \"One Ring\", which was created by the Dark Lord Sauron to dominate all of Middle Earth, and take it out of the Shire, as Sauron's forces are searching for it. This leads Frodo along with his fellow hobbits Sam, Pippin, and Merry to embark on a journey to the elven outpost of Rivendell. They encounter various dangers along the way, including Old Man Willow, barrow wights, and the sinister Black Riders, servants of Sauron. Along the way, they meet Aragorn, a ranger of the North who is their guide for much of the way. Once in Rivendell, they enjoy the hospitality of the resident Elf Lord Elrond. Soon a great council is held in Rivendell and it is decided that the only way to get rid of the Ring and to stop Sauron is to destroy it in the furnaces of Mount Doom, deep within the black land of Mordor, Sauron's realm. Hence, the titular Fellowship of the Ring is formed. It consists of the four hobbits, along with the wizard Gandalf, the elf Legolas, the dwarf Gimli, and the men Boromir and Aragorn. They now embark on their epic journey, in which they must make their way through the wilderness, the Mines of Moria, and beyond. Along the way they encounter such vile creatures as Orks, Wargs, a Balrog, and Uruk-hai. It all ends with the breaking of the fellowship as Frodo and Sam must make their way into Mordor, while the rest of the fellowship will soon be engulfed in the War of the Ring.I found this book to be absolutely, incredibly, astonishingly, spectacularly amazing. The story and characters are captivating and a brilliantly developed writing style is used to convey both enormous vistas as well as a plethora of back stories. The beginning of the book is very slow, since it takes the characters half of the book to even get out of the Shire. After that however, the speed picks up and the story becomes truly enthralling.

There were endless pages of me squirming through the group walking in the woods. The second something exciting happened, it was both very sudden and very quick, which left me feeling a little numb after it happened, because I knew I was going to be back to a series of walks through the woods. That being said, every interesting thing that happened was so exciting. The first 50 or so pages along with the last were my favorite. Book One was necessary, but I feel like it dragged too much. I was glad to reach Book Two where things finally picked up (plus, Gandalf!). There was a lot of information to take in, so I think part of the reason it took me so long to finish is because I tried my best to understand every detail rather than skim over or ignore the parts that weren't so obvious. I feel like I'd been reading this for months, or however long the characters trudged through this book - and in this case, I'd have to say that's a good thing.

The ring contains the power of the Dark Lord, Sauron, that was defeated long long ago, but the only thing that Bilbo knows about the ring is that wearing it can cause him to become invisible. He is unaware of the significance of the ring and that Sauron is on his way to look for the ring.Before Bilbo went on his trip a friend of him called Gandalf the Grey came and visit him, Gandalf suspected that the ring is the legendary ring and told Bilbo to drop it. Bilbo gave the ring to his heir Frodo and told him that the ring have to be taken far away to Mordor to destroy it. So Frodo goes on an adventure with his friends Sam, Merry, Pippin to destroy the ring. The hobbits make it to the town of Bree and met Aragorn. Which he advised the hobbits not to sleep in the inn because Sauron will send Dark Riders to kill them. The next day, Aragorn help the hobbits to avoid the Dark Riders safely but at night the hobbits attracted the Dark Riders which they have to defend their self. But unfortunately Frodo got stabbed in the shoulder which if he don`t get heal soon he would die. And luckily near Rivendell they met the Elf-lord Glorfindel, who has been out looking for them.

Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, an Elf named Legolas, a Dwarf named Gimli, and a Man from the south named Boromir, they are all in the team. The rest of the party continues on to L\u00f3rien, the forest of the Galadrim Elves, where the Lady Galadriel tests their hearts and gives them gifts to help them on the quest.

{"text": "\n           \n           Overall, this book was really great. I was able to really get into the book after I started to read it more often. Tolkien does a fantastic job at making the reader feel as if he is submerged in the surroundings of Middle-Earth. He does this through his vivid imagery, describing every location that the Hobbits, and later the Fellowship, encounter throughout their journeys. Tolkien also does a great job of characterizing all the characters mostly through the way that they react to certain scenarios. For example, Gimli can be seen as an eager character because of his desire to pass through Moria despite the dangers and his want to behold the Mirrormere. Tolkien depicts Boromir as an arrogant character, one who wants everything to go his way. Another important aspect of Tolkien's writing is that it advocates bravery, as the only way that Frodo has been able to make it as far as he has is because of his courage. One thing that I found that took away from the novel was the almost day-to-day summing of events that occurred, especially during the journey to Rivendell. Tolkien goes on and on about minor events that take place during this journey that are almost irrelevant to the plot, causing the novel to be a long and boring read at the beginning. The book does get better after a while and got real interesting once the Fellowship took off to the south. The first book of the series concludes with Frodo and Sam splitting up from the rest of the Company and setting about on the rest of the journey by themselves.

My favorite scenes were the trip through the lands of Moria and the chase with the black riders. The Black Riders were the most terrifying creatures I've ever read about. You could literally feel them sniffing for you and see there dark blind faces searching for you. J.R.R Tolkien really made you feel that you were being chased into the dark forest and hiding from unseen enemies. Then in the Prancing pony the screams of the Riders were coming from every dark corner of my room. The trip through the lands of Moria were equally terrifying. The drums of the Orcs heard in the distance and the patter of unseen feet were enough to make you jump out of your skin. The dark halls of Moria made me imaging the endless twisting paths leading to darkness and shadow. And suddenly the cries of the orcs, Cave trolls and the Balrog fire demon of the depths of Moria were just so real.I strongly believe this book is the best book I have and will ever read. The splendor of the literature and descriptions cannot be found in any other book. Although the first 60 pages are quite slow, once Frodo leaves the Shire you will forget their weariness.

This book was revolutionary for its time in creating a setting that is so vast and so complicated, that it ends up undermining the story, which I think should be the driving force.  The setting in of itself, is very impressive, and it is clear that Tolkien put many hours into developing it. Filled with its own languages and cultures, each containing their own lineages, lore, and myths, it's actually daunting. This incredible setting is what became a template for years to come in the fantasy genre.  However, the story is totally undermined by its setting, containing a simple plot, description that is used lavishly, lore that seemed pointless, and bits of prose that didn't seem to add to the story much at all (the chapter of Tom Bombadil was without question the most random chapter I've read, one that I thought should of been omitted entirely).

Tolkiens prelude to the trilogy, ) is visited by the wizard Gandalf. When Bilbo had left years ago he had left his magical and mystical Ring which he had taken from Gollum in his earlier adventures to Frodo. From Gandalf Frodo learns that this Ring is actually the Ring of Power from the Elven lore:One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themLost for centures, if this ring should fall back into the hands of the evil Sauron, he would be enabled to destory everything which is good in Middle-earth, bringing the land into darkness. Frodo and his hobbit friends Sam, Pippin, and Merry travel to the Rivendell to seek counsel from the Elf Elrond on what to do with the ring. There he finds out that he must destroy the Ring and to do that, must cast it into Mount Doom, located at the very center of Sauron's dark kingdom. Thus the Fellowship is created to help Frodo in his journey. The Fellowship consists of Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Aragorn the Ranger who is not what he seems, Legolas of the Elves of Mirkwood, Boromir a man of Gondor, and Gimli the dwarf from the Lonely Mountains. Together the nine set out for Mount Doom. But the way is treacherous and the dark, evil Ringwraiths are searching for them.But the story doesn't end here. If you have never read the books and you want to try it out, I suggest that you get all three books, not just the first one because this. If you like it, I assure you that you will be in agony at the end to find out what happens. The books are very addictive and it's very hard to stop at just . Have  and  on hand.My favorite character has got to be the Elf, Legolas. Elves have always fascinated me, for their mysterious, quiet, and almost immortal ways. I love it also how Legolas and Gimli the Dwarf in this book are sort of unfriendly towards each other since Elves and Dwarves usually do not get along. But towards the end of this book and the rest of the trilogy, they're the greatest of friends and inseparable.Another good character is Pippin the hobbit with his bright and cheerful ways. One of the youngest of the group of hobbits, he is always in a positive mood but somehow manages to get in trouble often.All of the books in the trilogy are must reads. Also the prelude to the trilogy, , should also be read to understand the events which had happened before the . Though it is written mostly for adults, I'm sure teenagers wil also love it, though younger kids might not be able to understand it. Enjoy, this book will have you fascinated and keep you in total suspense!\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Lauren", "stars": "5", "date": "Sep 07, 14", "likes": "1"},
{"text": "\n           \n           Well..what can I say about one of the most talked about books EVER..?I have read The Hobbit many times before, it was one of my favourite books as a kid, but for some reason, I never read the Lord of the Rings. I saw the collection on Ebay and the set looked beautiful so I decided it was a high time I should.It's definitely a book you have to set aside time for, if you're hoping for a quick easy read - this isn't it.I'm not going to lie, (and I am aware that this will be an unpopular opinion) Tom Bombadil frustrated the hell out of me. I could not STAND him. I just couldn't see the point in why he was there and what that part of the journey achieved? I sort of felt it detracted from the creepiness of the Riders and their story arc. I had the feeling that he was supposed to be like the embodiment of the forest or it's spirit...I just didn't understand why the spirit of the forest would talk in petulant rhymes and wear a blue coat and yellow boots. Oh and the continuous singing? Some of them were really lovely, granted, but it got to the point where you're just like \"oh another song? Thrilling.\"Moving on, once Tom Bombadil had disappeared into a distant and faded memory it.....got...good. There were moments of pure brilliance in the first half but from the first chapter of the second half (\"The Council of Elrond\") it became addictive. Even when the story was slow you were entranced. It's clear Tolkien knew every aspect of his world and had made it richer with the histories of each race. I can't really explain it but there's something about his writing that is somehow...warm? Gah I know what I mean.Also, I love Sam Gamjee,  his character is so lovely and earnest you can tell Tolkien wrote him with a lot of love. Legolas and Gimli don't really develop until later in the book, and I don't know why but I love their friendship! The scene with Gimli and Galadriel is both touching and humorous at the same time.Finally, Gollum. He is by far Tolkien's best creation (in my opinion) you're introduced to his story early in the book without actually having met him yet (unless, of course, you've read The Hobbit.) Then he is mentioned sporadically throughout the book until finally you realize that it is him that was following them from Moria. I can't wait to see more of Gollum in the next few books! Eeek so excited!Ultimately, this is a really detailed novel, well worth reading but if you want continuous, fast-paced action or a quick read, it may not be for you. If you are a big fan of fantasy, this is probably one of the best books you could ever choose. Reading this book inspired me to make a new shelf entitled \"authors-that-knew-their-shit\" and that Tolkien did...that he did.

I think only 5 times, but it might be more; and each time I've enjoyed it, sometimes more than others. The last time I read it (on audiobook, in preparation for a class on fantasy and science fiction that I was a TA for), I enjoyed Tom Bombadil more than I ever have--and I remember viscerally hating that whole section the first time. (I think part of why I enjoyed Bombadil this last time is the same reason why I enjoyed Shelob--because these two figures don't really fit into the grand epic of Sauron vs. the West. They puncture the fantasy. (And yes, I've heard that in other books, Tolkien makes some notes that make some sense of Shelob in the grand saga. But really--does Bombadil ever make sense here?))I have some sympathy for Michael Moorcock's savaging of Tolkien in his article, \"Epic Pooh,\" on how Tolkien's fantasies are primarily consolation and bad faith nostalgia.

This is followed by Frodo sitting on the seat of a king where he views all of Middle Earth being ravaged by Sauron's armies. The characters sitting around a fire and Middle Earth engaged in pitch battle are perfectly held in balance. Here is part of what makes this trilogy so wonderful.

I appreciated the clarity of the prose and Tolkien's deftness at creating suspense, horror, and wonder. Middle-earth and its inhabitants are painted in very few strokes and thus have the vividness of dreams.(For that reason, the eternal fan dithering about Balrog wings and Legolas' hair color totally misses the point\u2014you, the reader, decide what color Legolas' hair is. As a younger person, I absolutely read these novels with a fannish impatience, wanting to know details that are beyond the scope of Tolkien's prose. Now I have learned to be patient and trust my own imagination.)(But just to be clear, Balrogs definitely do not have wings.)Once more, the Shire was awesome and charming. I love how it is simply and unequivocally a pre-industrial England that never was (and which certainly does not belong in this quasi-medieval world). I suspect that Pippin may be an Oxford undergraduate. I have an image of him and Merry boating on the Isis and eating cucumber sandwiches.December 2009 review:This was, I think, my first time actually reading LotR directly after The Hobbit. It was a weird experience! The first half of Fellowship really is still in the world of The Hobbit, which reflects the experiences of the hobbits themselves, but also of course is the legacy of Tolkien's writing process. In many ways he used the actual process of creating the novel to structure the novel.Some thoughts, from the point-of-view of someone who has read this book way too many times:Everything set in the Shire is just totally awesome and charming. This allows the Shire to be a tangible presence through the rest of the novel. Bilbo is also a great character - Tolkien took the last scene of The Hobbit where Bilbo composes his first poem, and just ran with it.Everything from Frodo's departure until Bree feels very episodic and Hobbit-y. Which does work, but I'm still not sure about Tom Bombadil. Tom Bombadil stops the novel. He knows this. He laughs in the face of plot. Would it have been better for Tolkien to have put something else there? Not sure. Tom Bombadil is the first one to tell them stories about the past, and it's there that Frodo has his dream of Tol Eressea. So Tolkien thought he was important to the larger whole at least, even once the novel had grown past his initial conception of The Hobbit II.Aragorn is a lot of fun. I like how he can converse at the level of the hobbits and of the Elves. People who complain about Arwen being a non-character need to go back and reread Aragorn telling the story of Luthien and Beren. There is so much emotion on the page there.I also really liked the fording of the river Nimrodel to signal their entrance into Lothlorien - a symbol of purification that I hadn't noticed before.This used to be my favorite book of the trilogy, but of course Tolkien never wanted it split up as a trilogy, and rereading it I can't help but look forward to the more substantial, less Tom Bombadil-y bits that come later![\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Becky", "stars": "5", "date": "Feb 25, 15", "likes": "1"},

{"text": "\n           \n           What a great story so far, though I knew this one would be fun. I started The Hobbit when I was a kid but for some reason didn't get into it. I saw the The Lord of the Rings movies when they came out and really loved the story.The book is very accessible, IMO, and is wonderfully descriptive. These characters are so familiar, but not only because of the movies - I have seen aspects of them in my family and friends.

I really enjoyed reading the Tom Bombadil passages and thought the character was interesting-- kinda wish there was more on him. Another difference is Strider and Boromir. I felt that Strider was a much stronger character in the book and not as scared as the one portrayed in the movie. Boromir was also a bit shocking. I liked him better in the movie where he didn't seem like such an ass, whereas in the book he was too much in my face. Too much pride Boromir, too much.

From the hole at Bag-End where Frodo lives to the world of Middle Earth, every single part of this story is so immersive. It seems that Tolkien made a whole world with different land before even creating this book and it's really amazing to see what he has done. You follow the life of Frodo Baggins who is left with the Ring to rule them all by his uncle, Bilbo. This ring allows the user to become invisible, but can have the user end up being greedy and unlike him/herself. This is shown in the instance where two brothers, Smeagol and Deagol, both found the ring and ended up killing each other for it with Smeagol soon keeping the ring to live in the mountains as Gollum, a very small skinny creature. Knowing the abilities that this ring possesses, Frodo, along with his companions must set off to Mount Doom where he must destroy the ring to get rid off its powers. On his journey he must face many obstacles, like ring-wraiths, and gather many friends to be able to destroy this ring. I love this book because it has the perfect amount of comedy, adventure, and drama it needs. Overall, this book as amazing and is definitely worth the shot!

Yet in spite of this I found myself captivated. Even with extensive dialogue scenes I couldn't put the book down, and I can only say that it is thanks to his excellent craftsmanship that he -- and he alone -- can manage to get away with drawn-out scenes that manage to encompass one's intrigue.

The first volume in a trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring is about a young hobbit named Frodo and a dangerous, mysterious task he has to embark on. He has many obstacles, but he does not face these things without the help of some friends. Set in a world full of magic, mystery, beauty, and evil, this book will transport you to another world, and leave you grasping for more. This book is extremely well written and has so much imagination involved, which made me feel like I was experiencing each moment in the book myself and enjoy it immensely. The Fellowship of the Ring also has so much deep symbolism, which allowed me to connect some of the conflicts going on in the novel to real world conflicts, which made it even more enjoyable. This book would be enjoyed by anybody who needs a world to escape to, and characters to relate to. Not only do the characters in this book go on a journey, but the reader goes with them, with every step. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Eliza Hayse", "stars": "5", "date": "Oct 31, 15", "likes": "0"},

As with most good books that would otherwise be called genre fiction, I wouldn't say it's fantasy but literature that happens to be fantasy. The prose is good and well-written. The rambling parts make sense as to why they're rambling and there's a great sense of the story being retold. The heros are faced with a parade of perils and each is interesting and different with a new feel to each.Going in, expected long descriptive passages but there were few. The description was more atmospheric. The place names, character opinions, and remaining details were enough to provide a feeling of the place. Chances are, two readers wouldn't come upon the same image but I feel they would come upon the same idea.The book ended abruptly and some of the song-asides were longer than I wished but Tolkien had set himself the challenge of writing a long story.

{"text": "\n           \n           Wow. If you\u2019re looking for a novel that throws you into a story head first and completely washes over you with a new and exciting world, then you have come to the right place. The Fellowship of The Ring: Being the First part of The Lord of the Rings, by: J.R.R. Tolkien is a book filled with captivating climaxes and endless twists and turns (literally) that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good read. \tTolkien begins the story by creating a culture that is entirely complex and realistic. He gives them traditions, folklore, and even family lineage. This culture is none other than the hobbits. This creation of a culture so real, along with many others (elves, humans, dwarves, etc.) is what makes Tolkien such a fantastic writer. All throughout the book are songs and stories from the pasts of these characters. As Frodo (the protagonist) goes along his journey, the audience discovers folklore from all of these ancient lineages, and they interlock, connecting ideas together and furthering the development of the story.\tAnother aspect that Tolkien brings to the table is one of mystery in danger. As the story unfolds, Frodo is faced with the danger of the unknown. Enemies known as \u201cblack riders\u201d threaten his safety, and rather than knowing everything about them and their plans, we actually learn with Frodo. This mystery allows us to play along with Frodo\u2019s adventures and have genuine fear for him and his friends. Without this sense of the unknown, readers would grow bored because all of the answers would already be clear and there would be nothing to discover.\tOne rarely finds a treasure such as this book and it would be a shame to miss out on the style that the author uses and conveys so clearly. Don\u2019t miss out on the opportunity to digest this book for all its worth and buy it.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Carter", "stars": "5", "date": "Nov 03, 15", "likes": "0"},

All thanks to the funky looking new box set of Lord of the Rings which I got recently, for making me read this one.Lotr, a fantasy novel about the adventures of four hobbits from a lovely town called Shire. The novel starts with such a beautiful picture of Shire, that you fall in love with these little Halflings immediately. As these four travels around the kingdom, an unimaginable array of landscapes and elvish wonders are described in an enchanting way.As the story goes by, things get darker and murkier. The surroundings of the journey of the ring bearer and his comrade, reflects the mood of the story in many ways. Starting from the brighter Shire, in the end, they reach the gloomy Mont doom, where their destiny waits them.Every story will have a character who clings to your mind even after you finish reading that story. Here, Its Aragorn for me. The one who comes into the story as a untidy and dangerous wanderer, quickly makes way into your hearts.  The King indeed has all the humility and wisdom need by the true lord of Gondor. I loved this character and most of the times, I devoured the parts where Aragorn was there than any other chapters of the book. May be it\u2019s the superficial subtleness and the underlying courage of this character which attracted me! Nevertheless Viggo Mortensen got a loyal fan for sure. Its one book which I would recommend to any one who love fantasy novels, who love to build things in the mind and feel how wonderful they are. One strong suggestion is please wait for the book series to finish of before jumping to the film series.Would love to give a 5/5\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Sree Devi", "stars": "5", "date": "Nov 09, 15", "likes": "0"},

Je suis donc en accord avec un des attraits propos\u00e9s par Mme Desrochers. M\u00eame si plusieurs qu\u00eates sont effectu\u00e9es au cours de l\u2019ouvrage, il reste que l\u2019intrigue principale est assez lin\u00e9aire et chronologique, dans le sens o\u00f9 toutes les qu\u00eates sous-jacentes tendent \u00e0 converger vers le m\u00eame but ultime. Le style d\u2019\u00e9criture de l\u2019auteur ne n\u00e9cessite pas de la part du lecteur une r\u00e9flexion pouss\u00e9e pour faire des liens entre les diff\u00e9rents \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019histoire, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019effleure jamais les sujets, mais y va au contraire tr\u00e8s en profondeur.

Par ailleurs, il y a l\u2019attrait usuel des personnages identifiables que j\u2019ai personnellement jug\u00e9 aussi important que celui du d\u00e9cor d\u00e9taill\u00e9 propos\u00e9 par Mme Desrochers, ne serait-ce que de par leurs caract\u00e9ristiques propres et tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9es qui semblent intrins\u00e8quement reli\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019intrigue principale. Cependant, la description des lieux et de leur ambiance est un attrait tr\u00e8s important du genre fantasy en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, donc je ne suis pas du tout en d\u00e9saccord avec Mme Desrochers. Une faiblesse serait peut-\u00eatre au niveau du rythme, car en effet, ces longues descriptions am\u00e8nent souvent un rythme lent qui peut s\u2019av\u00e9rer ardu \u00e0 lire pour certains lecteurs.

I do not reccomend them for kids with a lower reading level. I will be reviewing the Fellowship of the Ring. The Fellowship of the Ring starts off in Hobbiton. Bilbo leaves with a bang and Frodo starts off on a journey of his own after discovering that Bilbo's ring of invisability is the Ring of Power or Master Ring. An inscription is found on the ring reading:which is part of a larger verse:Gandalf tells Frodo not to use the ring and to leave Hobbiton. Frodo obeys and leaves immediately! After leaving, he ran into Black Riders or Ring Wraiths and his adventures only get more exiting from there!The Main Characters are Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Boromir. Each one of them represents the hobbits, the humans, the dwarfs or the elves and each one are members of the fellowship and very important in all the books.This book circles around the strive for power and triumphing over evil. The story has a moral which is that you should not go looking for lots and lots of power.The setting is in lots of places, however the story starts on Bilbo's birthday in Hobbiton in Middle Earth and quickly moves into the forest around Hobbiton followed by a farm and the dark forest.I think for the 6th grade and up reading levels it is a wonderful book that is very enjoyable and I would give it 5 stars. If it has one fault it is that the information chaptors drag on and on. The book feels very complete and you sometimes feel like you could be standing right inside the book. The book is also very memorable.

{"text": "\n           \n           The Fellowship of the RingFor this month I read the first book in the series The Lord of the Ring, which is called the Fellowship of the Ring, written by J.R.R Tolkien. It is about a hobbit, a small human, named Frodo, who goes on an adventure to destroy the last ring before Sauron, the Dark Lord, collects them all. There, Frodo see all the dangers outside his hobbit hole. The theme of the book is you shouldn\u2019t be afraid of fear itself. Throughout the book, Frodo had to escape Sauron, which basically sucks in the light and lives all the horror and fear. When the black riders attack Frodo and his friends , his friends threw themselves on the ground, left with fear and horror. They needed to go to Mordor which is basically guarded by the evilest people you can imagine. One writing style Tolkien uses is very detailed descriptions. He uses that so readers can imagine the settings very clearly. It gives the readers a more interesting view of the book because then it is just like a real world. It makes the book seem like it's coming to life. A larger issue it might connect to is bullying. It slowly sucks out their fun and all they think about is what people think of them or what the people will do to them. A negative opinion on the book is that sometime he goes a little over the top with description. It is mostly great because it also describes the action, but after you read it a lot it gets a little boring. They live in a world full of fear. My advice to the readers is that they should know that the book is really good but it comes with a lot of details.

Lord of the Rings is one of them. Having seen the films and have read The Hobbit quite a while ago, I have always wanted to pick up this book and bask in Tolkien\u2019s awesome Middle-Earth.As many of you may know, the story is an epic journey spanning three books, this is the opening of the journey and though it may not have the fast electric pace of a Dan Brown novel. It is the creation of something that can\u2019t be told in 24 hours, this book spans many years and each of them told intricately. Whenever I read a book written by a person considered a literary great such as Tolkien, I sometimes feel that by writing a review of the book such as this, any remark I make against the author, it is as if I am criticising someone I am not allowed to. Despite that pressure, I do honestly feel that he does tend to go over board with the travelling and long descriptions of Middle-Earth history with names I have forgotten. Granted, I appreciate the meticulous detail he shows when he tries to create the scene and give the reader the best possible view of what is happening. But I felt that rather than reading hundreds of pages at a time and finishing the book in a few days, I was reading to the end of the chapter, putting it down and coming back to it later. The Fellowship of the Ring was not set out to be a gripping page turner, rather it was the introduction and mood setter for a colossal story which I know from the films becomes more exciting and enthralling as The Company gets nearer to its goal, but I still felt a little underwhelmed..........\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Richard Humphreys", "stars": "4", "date": "Jul 07, 15", "likes": "0"},

The descriptions of the landscape is gorgeous and he doesn't have those unwieldy object descriptions (I'm looking at you, George RR Martin). The writing about the characters is surprisingly wonderful in its simplicity, and though it seems a bit too sparse at first, it surprises you with the gradual revealing of character development thorough actions and not simply thoughts. And it's amazingly quotable. **Also the songs irked me at first, but they get better as you go on.

Per cui ho letto questo romanzo con leggerezza, in poco pi\u00f9 di una settimana, senza fermarmi a riflettere, ed ecco cosa ne \u00e8 uscito in quattro parole:lo consiglio a tutti, \u00e8 coinvolgente, ben scritto e per nulla noioso. Il film, come sempre, non gli rende giustizia, e neanche questo commento. Per chi vuole, ho scritto giusto due righe, per tenere a mente i punti pi\u00f9 importanti.L'anello \u00e8 , per definizione, un \"cerchietto di metallo, per lo pi\u00f9 prezioso, che si porta infilato in un dito della mano come ornamento, come simbolo del vincolo matrimoniale, come insegna di dignit\u00e0, e simili\" (Treccani). Rappresenta quindi un oggetto di bellezza, di immagine, e solitamente \u00e8 prezioso - e cos\u00ec, infatti, sono quasi tutti gli anelli della Terra di Mezzo, la regione che Tolkien ha creato grazie alla sua lunga esperienza in materia di letteratura antica e medioevale. Si tende ad attribuire a questo la veridicit\u00e0 della Contea, di Gran Burrone, di L\u00f2rien e degli altri posti e, in parte sono d'accordo. L'abilit\u00e0 di Tolkien \u00e8,che io sappia, ineguagliata in questo campo, ma credo dipenda moltissimo dalla sua, come dire, necessit\u00e0 di applicazione: non poteva necessariamente lasciare qualcosa in sospeso, monco, perch\u00e8 la vicenda stessa lo richiedeva. Tutti gli anelli sono ornamenti, preziosi, e dotati di una qualche capacit\u00e0 di spicco (\"potere magico\" \u00e8 un termine che fa storcere il naso); tutti tranne uno, l'Unico. Esso \u00e8 spoglio, senza scritte o gioielli, ma rappresenta un simbolo temibile. Si narra, infatti, che i maestri nel forgiare amuleti magici, gli Elfi, nel tentativo di accrescere la loro potenza culturale, intellettuale, conoscitiva sulle cose del mondo avessero accettato l'aiuto (non si sa di che natura) di un emergente Signore, Sauron, il quale, appresa l'arte della creazione dei manufatti, avrebbe creato un anello speciale in grado di soggiogare, comandare e dirigere la volont\u00e0 degli altri. Similmente, avrebbe donato tre anelli magici agli Elfi, sette ai Nani e nove agli Uomini, cos\u00ec da tenere sotto la sua ala le principali razze dominatrici della Terra di Mezzo. Rieccheggia in questo racconto ancestrale il motivo che ha reso famoso Doctor Faustus o, quantomeno, avvertiamo, piegati al nostro gusto, l'eco della sete di conoscenza, della tentazione demoniaca, del desiderio di onnipotenza che caratterizza gli esseri viventi. E' Omero che muore attraversando le colonne d'Ercole (Dante), \u00e8 Icaro che precipita. Ma i protagonisti di questa leggenda sono una razza diversa dagli Uomini, mortali, inclini al Male, vigliacchi ed egoisti: gli Elfi, gli esseri pi\u00f9 saggi della Terra di Mezzo, erano in origine non dissimili da coloro che desiderano acquistare potere per elargirne e per essere venerati; le mire egotiche sono dissimulate da leggende, racconti tramandati, ma quello che la storia non racconta viene detto dalla paura che rivela il fuoco acceso di notte. Gli Elfi hanno acquistato, all'epoca del racconto, grande potere e grande saggezza, sono combattenti e spiriti silvani gioiosi e malinconici, ma non danno mai consigli, non compiono mai azioni direttamente, non influenzano mai qualcosa o qualcuno nelle scelte. Sono neutrali. Questo li rende personaggi angelici, ma terribili se visti alla luce della leggenda della creazione degli anelli: gli Elfi sono paralizzati dalla paura di cedere ancora alla tentazione. La loro forma aulica \u00e8 un'abile dissulazione del peccato originale, proprio come Adamo ed Eva che raccontano della serpe. Sauron, che grazie all'anello diviene un potente signore, viene sconfitto dalle forze congiunte degli Uomini e degli Elfi, ma continua ad agire, depauperato ma attivo, con la brama di riacquistare potere, forza e vigore. Per farlo, ha bisogno dell'anello. Due sono i temi \"immateriali\" introdotti da Tolkien: l'autonomia dell'anello nel decidere e la predestinazione. L'anello si muove, vuole tornare al suo padrone, \u00e8 dotato di volont\u00e0 e, ovviamente, essa non \u00e8 dissimile da quella del suo signore, la cui forza vince tutti. L'anello simoleggia una persona che simboleggia ... cosa? La tentazione? Il potere? Non lo sappiamo. Con un gioco di specchi, Sauron diventa attivo attraverso l'anello, il quale diventa ornamento e simbolo della terribile ed immonda presenza del Male terreno. L'altro tema legato all'anello \u00e8 la predestinazione. Frodo deve portare l'anello: le figure di spicco insistono perch\u00e8 sia cos\u00ec, hanno bisogno di un capro espiatorio e viene creato, dall'alto della loro saggezza, la predestinazione. Frodo deve perch\u00e8 l'anello \u00e8 capitato a lui. Questo, unito alla presenza di una volont\u00e0 radicata nell'oggetto, non lascia al protagonista alcuno scampo. E guai a chi cerca di trasgredire questo sottile ma coerente disegno umano: chi cerca di rompere la trama, viene soggiogato dal potere dell'anello, perde se stesso, cade in rovina. Non c'\u00e8 scampo, per nessuno che intenda ribellarsi. Oppure c'\u00e8? Dopo alcune peripezie, l'oggetto finisce nelle mani di Bilbo Baggins, il quale appartiene alla razza dei Mezzuomini, gli Hobbit. Eccezionalemnte longevo, Bilbo sparisce dalla Contea, regione della Terra di Mezzo, lasciando i suoi averi nelle mani di un giovane ma ben educato Frodo, nipote e figlioccio di Bilbo. Gli Hobbits sono creature agricole, semplici, suscettibili e facilmente influenzabili da dicerie, equivoci, tali da possedere tutta la fierezza sdegnosa e bigotta degli ignoranti; ma sono, quando serve, ingegnosi, coraggiosi oltre ogni aspettativa, e saggi in situazioni che sgominano il senno di Nani, Elfi e Uomini. Ci\u00f2 nonostante, Frodo e i suoi amici, Sam e Marry e Pipino, devono arrangiarsi con quello che hanno, sono trasportati da eventi complessi e pi\u00f9 grandi di loro, ma acquistano, col viaggio, sempre pi\u00f9 consapevolezza e robustezza d'animo. I personaggi della famosa Compagnia si evolvono durante la vicenda. Non parler\u00f2 del tenace Legolas, l'elfo arciere interpretato da Orlando Bloom, o di Gimli, robusto e tenero nano, n\u00e8 di Marry e Pipino, cugini collaterali di Frodo, \u00e8erch\u00e8 essi sono personaggi di contorno, essenziali e ben caratterizzati come molti altri (come quasi tutti, anche il cavallo, Billy). Lo stesso Gandalf, il saggio ed imeprscrutabile stregone, dovr\u00e0 transmutare alla fine della vicenda: salver\u00e0 gli altri membri del gruppo, cadr\u00e0 in un baratro malefico e ne uscir\u00e0 solo nel secondo capitolo, Le Due Torri, completamente cambiato. Gandalf rappresenta non solo la saggezza, di cui \u00e8 palesemente il rappresentante, ma anche una figura particolare, non umano e non divino, che non pu\u00f2 desiderare il potere per s\u00e8 perch\u00e8 questo significherebbe essere INTERESSATI a fare del bene. Gandalf \u00e8 la libert\u00e0 di scelta, il perseguimento del giusto scopo anche a costo della vita, e per quanto rappresenti una prospettiva stoica e contemporaneamente ascetica dell'esistere, in realt\u00e0 si avvicina sempre alla trama di fondo della vicenda: se qualcuno ti offrisse il potere di essere quello che si vuole, lo accetteresti? Gandalf pu\u00f2 prendere l'anello, gli viene anche offerto, e pu\u00f2 unirsi al suo maestro Saruman, potente mago che ha ceduto alla volont\u00e0 di Sauron, ma alla fine del primo libro cade dal ponte delle miniere di Moria, fra le fiamme, per difendere fino in fondo il suo intento e la sua volont\u00e0. Non senza tristezza, dubbi, scatti d'ira: \u00e8 sensibile, potentissimo e fragile. Tutti ne piangono la scomparsa, perch\u00e8 se \u00e8 caduto lui, nessuno pu\u00f2 farcela. Serve una buona dose di autostima, abilmente inculcata dagli Elfi, per far proseguire la Compagnia. Il nuovo capo diventa Aragorn, chiamato anche Grampasso o D\u00f9nadan (Numenoreani), un discendente della stirpe reale degli Uomini che vaga per l Terre di Mezzo, senza una terra su cui regnare, come in una eterna diaspora iniziata dopo che Isildur, il Re dell'antico regno degli Uomini, ha strappato via a Sauron l'anello. La decadenza della stirpe umana \u00e8 decretata dal cedimento del sovrano al potere in s\u00e8 in quanto Male. Ogni tradimento della propria condizione immanente (mortale e non) per acquistare potere genera la caduta. Il tema ricorre nella mitologia, nella letteratura, nella filosofia, in tutto quello che \u00e8 umano e Tolkien non poteva non piazzarcelo, anche inconsciamente, perch\u00e8 i suoi personaggi devono dare speranza al lettore, che \u00e8 calato come i protagonisti, in un'atmosfera cupa e senza via di scampo, destinata apparentemente a secondare il Male e gli intenti dei suoi servitori. Frodo, un mezzuomo che si scopre eroe; Gandalf, uno stregone che deve mettersi in discussione; e Aragorn, un umile e disilluso nobile ripudiato: questi tre personaggi vengono trafitti dalla vicenda e la cambiano raccontandola.Ci sarebbe tantissimo altro da dire. Aragorn \u00e8 una figura attraente oltre ogni modo, che credo verr\u00e0 sviluppata anche nei racconti a venire. Molto del quadro generale mi sfugge. Vorrei chiudere questi appunti con una nota sul mio personaggio preferito, Boromir, di cui nutro una profonda stima (nel film la sua figura e il suo ruolo vengono portati al limite concettuale e fisico, tanto che muore anch'egli da eroe suonando il suo corno da battaglia). Boromir \u00e8 un uomo, esattamente come Aragorn; \u00e8 anch'egli di nobile stirpe, pur non discendendo dalla casata di Isildur, e valoroso. Mostra affetto, saggezza, ma anche collera e testardaggine, soprattutto alla fine. Sembra quasi che, con la morte di Gandalf e l'elezione di Aragorn a capo della Compagnia, sia stata tradita un'aspettativa di merito, che lui crede in qualche modo dovuta. Diventa, cos\u00ec, diffiente, scontroso, e il suo desiderio di acquistare potere aumenta, al punto che nell'ultimo capitolo litigher\u00e0 con Frodo, cercher\u00e0 di strappargli via l'anello, e spinger\u00e0 il protagonista a viaggiare da solo. Frodo attribuir\u00e0 la colpa all'anello, il ch\u00e8 parzialmente \u00e8 vero; ma Boromir resta sdraiato a terra, pensando a quello che ha fatto, a cosa \u00e8 diventato in quel momento (\"\u00e8 stata pazzia!\", dice), e piange per la misera sorte che \u00e8 stata riservata a lui e al suo popolo, che non si sente in grado di difendere. Tutto questo mi ha messo addosso tristezza, ma anche fierezza per il personaggi, mi ha riempito di ammirazione per l'autore, perch\u00e8 in Boromir si consuma una piccola tragedia e la terribile eco si sente , sul finale, ancora pi\u00f9 forte. \n         ", "book": "La compagnia dell'anello", "user": "Bsquared", "stars": "4", "date": "Aug 09, 15", "likes": "0"},

TolkienCharacters:There is Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin as Hobbits of the Shire, Gandalf the Wizard, Aragorn the Heir of Isildur, Legolas the Wood Elf of Mirkwood, Gimli the Dwarf, and Boromir from the city of Minas Tirith.Setting:Begins in the Shire, then to the Old Forest, the Town of Bree, Weathertop (an abandoned lookout they used for shelter overnight), Rivendell the City of the Elves, Caradhras (a snow-covered mountain they tried to traverse), the Mines of Moria, Lorien the home of the Galadhrim Elves, and lastly to Anduin the Great River.Plot of the Story:Bilbo Baggins, Frodo\u2019s stepfather, has grown too old because of the One Ring and is told by Gandalf to get rid of it. So Bilbo agrees and leaves for Rivendell to set off for a vacation of sorts. It falls unto Frodo to take it to Rivendell so that he can deliver it to the Elves. Sam also comes along, and on the way they meet up with Merry and Pippin not too far from the Shire, Aragorn at Bree, then they make it to Rivendell. There Lord Elrond, the ruler of the Elves of Rivendell, has a meeting to decide who will go with Frodo to destroy the Ring. The people who agree to go are Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Boromir. They then leave for the mountain Caradhras, but it\u2019s too dangerous so they go to the Mines of Moria. They make it out and go to the forest, Lorien, to recuperate. They then borrow boats from the Lorien Wood Elves, and follow the winding river, Anduin, and then the book ends not too long after.Opinion:I think that this is one of those books that is easy for most people to enjoy. It has an amazing story, great characters, thrilling action and adventure, and moments of joy, surprise, and sadness. But I would understand if not everybody would like it because of how long these kinds of books are, how long you stay in the perspective of only a couple characters, or because of confusing events that occur, like when Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin wander into the Old Forest. But that\u2019s probably the only confusing part I found in the book, so there won\u2019t be many people who would dislike it too much for it. Because the rest of the book is quite entertaining and has points of interest for for all kinds of readers. So in my opinion it\u2019s a book and series that many should read because of the quality entertainment it provides.Quotes:\u201cAll that is gold does not glitter,Not all those who wander are lost;The old that is strong does not wither,Deep roots are not reached by the frost.From the ashes a fire shall be woken,A light from the shadows shall spring;Renewed shall be blade that was broken,The crownless again shall be king.\u201d\u201cI wish it need not have happened in my time,\u201d said Frodo.\u201cSo do I,\u201d said Gandalf,\u201dand so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.\u201dRecommendations:As stated before in the paragraph below my opinion section, there are many people that would enjoy this book. But if I were to explain just what kind of people would like it, I would say that it would be a favorite for those who like a story full to the brim with all kinds of fantasy elements like magic or mystical creatures. And even if there\u2019s some that don\u2019t like that kind of genre, it\u2019s still a great story that they may still take a liking to.Rating:In conclusion, this book and series is an amazing adventure that keeps you intrigued and excited of what\u2019s to become of the heroes and the villains. So, with that said, I would give this book a four to five star rating for how undoubtably splendid it really is.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Trevor Gunn", "stars": "5", "date": "Oct 07, 15", "likes": "0"},
{"text": "\n           \n           The Fellowship of the RingOctober 11\u201cThe Fellowship of the Ring\u201d is the first book of the series of Lord of the Rings. J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the book full of suspense, action and adventure. Although the book was very long and some parts got uninteresting, J.R.R. still found a way to make it an exciting book. The story is about a a young innocent hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo Baggins finds himself in one of the most dangerous situations anyone could be in. Bilbo has come across the ring. The ring was crafted by the Elven-smiths and Sauron, the Dark Lord, who forged the ring filling it with all its power. If any source of evil acquires the ring, the world is doomed. Therefore, Bilbo Baggins is off to a very, very long journey to throw the ring into Mount Doom to destroy it. In my opinion I thought the book was worth reading. You just have to be very patient when reading it because it can feel very long. I am still not sure if I am going to continue on with the series because this book took me a while to read.

{"text": "\n           \n           Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is the quintessential epic fantasy novel, a pioneer of a totally new genre that found millions of fans in many entertainment platforms. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy by J. R. R. Tolkien, and sets the bar high for the two novels to come. The plot of the novel is more or less a traditional hero\u2019s quest story, but combining that with a unique setting, deep, complex characters, and exquisite detail makes this novel truly remarkable. The purpose of the book is to show that good can triumph over evil, even if the forces of evil have a great advantage. The main themes of the novel is the struggle of good versus evil and the corrupting power of the absolute power embodied by the one ring of power. The plot of The Fellowship of the Ring is the telling of the struggles of Frodo Baggins and his companions to first take the One Ring of Power from their home in the Shire to Rivendell, and from there, to take it to the land of Mordor to destroy it in the volcano from which it was made. Along the way, Tolkien\u2019s very descriptive style paints a picture of the lands which they cross. For example, the author\u2019s description of the appearance of a magical character named Tom Bombadil paints a vivid picture of the man: \u201cThere was another burst of song, and then suddenly, hopping and dancing along the path, there appeared above the reeds and old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in the band. With another hop and a bound there came into view a man, or so it seemed. At any rate he was too large and heavy for a hobbit, if not quite tall enough for one of the Big People, thought he made noise enough for one, stumping along with great yellow boots on his thick legs, and charging through the grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink. He had a blue coat and a long brown beard; his eyes were blue and bright, and his face was red as an apple, but creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughter.\u201dIn the first section of the book, Book I, Tolkien tells the story of Bilbo, along with his friend and servant Sam Gamgee and two cousins Merry and Pippen as they travel to Rivendell to take the One Ring to Elrond the half elf. They are chased by black riders. The black riders are in fact ringwraiths, men who were corrupted by the power of the rings long ago. They are now evil spirits totally enslaved to Sauron and the ring. Sauron is the main villain of this book. He is the lord of all evil things in Middle Earth and the maker of the one ring. The elves had made many rings of power. Sauron wanted to control those rings and the people who wore them. He particularly wanted to control the three most powerful rings made by the elves. In order to control the rings, Sauron put much of his evil and power into the ring in order to control the other rings of power made by the elves. The elves became aware of what he was doing and hid the three rings from him. Sauron used the other rings to enslave powerful men, the ringwraiths, and the dwarves. He offered the rings to his victims with the promise of power and long life only to enslave them with the evil power of the one ring.Bilbo and his companions are set on their quest to Rivendell by Gandolph the Grey, a wizard. They are supposed to meet Gandolph in the town of Bree to continue their journey to Rivendell. Gandolph is not in Bree when the companions arrive. Instead they meet a man named Strider, who is actually Aragorn, heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Gondor. Strider helps the hobbits get to Rivendell as they are pursued by the black riders all the way there.In Rivendell, there is a council of men, dwarves, elves and the wizard Gandolph. Gandolph reveals that he was held prisoner by the leader of the wizards, Saruman the White. Saruman has been corrupted by lust for the one ring and his fear of Sauron. It is decided that the only way to stop Sauron from conquering everything is to destroy the ring. Boromir, the son of the ruler of Gondor, wants to use the ring to defeat Sauron. Once again, the corrupting power of the ring is shown by Elrond\u2019s answer; \u201c\u2019Alas no\u2019, said Elrond, \u2018We cannot use the Ruling Ring. That we know too well. It belongs to Sauron and was made by him alone, and it is altogether evil. Its strength, Boromir, is too great for anyone to wield at will, save only those who already have great power of their own. But for them it holds an even deadlier peril. The very desire of it corrupts the heart. Consider Saruman. If any of the Wise should with this Ring overthrow the Lord of Mordor, using his own arts, he would then set himself on Sauron\u2019s thrown, and yet another Dark Lord would appear.\u201d Boromir still clearly wants to take the ring back to Gondor for them to use to defend the kingdom and defeat Sauron.Frodo volunteers to take the ring to Mordor with one of the best lines in the book; \u201c\u2019I will take the Ring,\u2019 he said, \u2018though I do not know the way\u2019\u201d It is decided that nine will set out to take the ring to Mordor to counter the nine Ringwraiths. The hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin are chosen along with the Gandalh, Strider, Boromir, Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf. They are tracked by Saruman, who forces them into the old Dwarves underground kingdom of Moria. There Gandolph falls apparently to his death fending off another evil creature called a Balrog. Tolkien again provides a vivid description of the evil creature; \u201cit was like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater: and a power and terror seemed to be in it and to go before it. \u2026 Then with a rush, it leaped across the fissure. The flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed about it; and a black smoke swirled in the air. +It\u2019s streaming mane kindled, and blazed behind it. In its right hand was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it held a whip of many thongs.\u201dAfter the fall of Gandolph, the remaining members of the fellowship retreat to the Elven land of Lorien. Lorien is ruled by elven queen Galadriel. Galadriel is one of the more powerful people in Middle Earth. Frodo offers the ring to Galadriel. Again the corrupting power of the ring is displayed when Galadriel says: \u201c\u2019Wise the Lady Galadriel may be,\u2019 she said, \u2018yet here she has met her match in courtesy. Gently you are revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting. You begin to see with a keen eye. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you offer. For many long years I had pondered what I might do, should the Great Ring come into my hands, and behold! It was brought within my grasp. The evil that was devised long ago works on in many ways, whether Sauron himself stands or falls. Would not that have been a noble deed to set to the credit of his Ring, if I had taken it by force or fear from my guest?\u2019\u2018And now at last it comes. You will give me the Ring freely! In place of a Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I shall not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Dreadful as the Storm and the Lightning! Stronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair!\u2019\u201dThe power of good to triumph over overpowering evil is then shown when Galadriel\u2019s goodness shows in this scene. She then says; \u201cI pass the test,\u2019 she said. \u2018I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain Galadriel.\u2019 This scene demonstrates Tolkien\u2019s very descriptive style of writing. One can see through his words both the temptation that Galadriel faces as well as the powerful ruler that using the ring would create,The final scene that shows the theme of the book occurs at the end when Boromir first tries to convince Frodo to take the ring to Gondor. Failing that, he tries to take the ring. Frodo uses the ring to become invisible and runs. Boromir instantly realizes what he has done and tries to find Frodo. Frodo decides that the ring is too much of a temptation for the rest of the party. He decided to finish the quest on his own. He almost succeeds in slipping away, but Sam guesses what he is doing and makes him take him across the river to find Mordor together.I think that this book, along with the other two parts of the trilogy, is one of the greatest examples of epic fantasy ever written. The book shows that good can triumph over evil, even when evil has an incredible advantage. The wise at Elrond\u2019s council, Galadriel, and even Boromir eventually refuse to succumb to the temptation to use the ring, knowing that anything they tried to do for good would be turned to evil. Throughout the book, Frodo demonstrates that he know the quest ultimately his responsibility. He knows that only he can destroy the ring, even though it would be easier to give it away or hide it. In the end, he leaves the company in order to finish the quest without harming anyone else with the temptation of the ring.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Michael Taylor", "stars": "5", "date": "Oct 14, 15", "likes": "0"},
{"text": "\n           \n           I love this story. It has always been with me ever since I was a child, and I even have a large hard bound edition of all three book that I open up every once in awhile and treat like a Bible. I just let the papges open to a random place and start reading from there. There is not a part of this story that I do not know really well. With that in mind, this is the slowest out of the three books. Like all Tolkien stories, it takes a long time to get started, but really introduces the reader to the world of Middle Earth. The problem with this book is that when it starts to get exciting and the pace of the story starts to move again, Tolkien slows it down for us to introduce more of the world that he has created. This is not to say that the world that Tolkien has created is not amazing and any casual reader can see everything about it, from the individual leaves of the trees to the carved sculptures left behind from the days of old. It is probably the strength of Tolkien's writings. If you pay attention you can also hear remenants of the same narrator that told the story of the Hobbit, but as the story progress this light-hearted storyteller disappears, and a more serious narrator takes his place. The transition is seemless, and it takes a few reading of this book to notice that it actually happens, but it makes sense due to the history of the publication of this novel, and the seriousness that the story has as the reader gets further into it. It is still a great story, but the absences of the additional star is due to the slowness of the prose. It is necessary though to enjoy the rest of the story, and is definitely worth picking up for a read at least a couple of times throughout your lifetime.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "John Collings", "stars": "4", "date": "Apr 08, 15", "likes": "0"},
{"text": "\n           \n           Even if you haven't read this book, you might be familiar with its title, thanks to the blockbuster movies by Peter Jackson. Don't let yourself be fooled! Although those movies are faithful to the books, you are not able to see Middle Earth through the eyes of Tolkien, when you are watching them. So, if you liked the films, it is worth a try to read them, as well. Moreover, if you still have the chance to read it first, because you haven\u2019t seen the movies, I would recommend you to explore this story in this way.This book is not easy to read. Sometimes it is hard to understand because of the archaic words and phrases, especially if your mother tongue is not English. So, it is even a great tool for practicing the language.A reason for reading could be that with these novels, Tolkien created a whole new genre, with magical creatures and supernatural powers. If you like those kinds of stories, you should read the story of the One Ring and its bearer as it is the very first significant fantasy story, ever. It is full of epic battles with heroes and villains, you can like or hate. You can support them or you can cross your fingers for their failure. As far as description is concerned, everything is pictured in a very detailed way throughout the whole story, so you can get to know all the important characters and their motivations and feelings. It is even made more colourful with the help of numerous poems, which you can find on websites, too, but the true way is to read and interpret them in their own environment.It is basically the universal and eternal fight between good and evil. The point of the story could be that simple. But, if you are that kind of person who likes looking for hidden meanings, this book contains satisfying surprises for you, as there are several possible interpretations of the story. I would let you, yourself discover all these, but let me just mention a pretty obvious one. As it was written during and right after World War 2, the novel can be the conflict between the two sides, moved into an imagined world.I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the genre of fiction. Or those who want to jitter for characters, knowing the good will always win. I am a fan of fantasy, so, of course, I enjoyed it. But, I think it is entertaining for those who are not really fan of it, so go ahead and read it, if you have time for it. If you don't, well, spare some time for yourself to read it!\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "M\u00e1t\u00e9 Balla", "stars": "5", "date": "Apr 27, 15", "likes": "0"},

I have read many different books so far, but I have never come across with such an excellent narrative style. For a non-native speaker, it is readable, yet challenging. Tolkien\u2019s vocabulary must have been very rich and diverse; you can absolutely feel that while you\u2019re reading.Another thing which is very interesting about the book is the applicability. You can experience pleasure and hear moral lessons at the same time. Personally, I am in love with the Shire. The hobbits, their traditions and the way they live, all these attributes fill me with joy even when I\u2019m thinking about it. For some reason William Wordsworth comes to my mind constantly in connection with the Shire. Can this be because the hobbits\u2019 lifestyle is might be based upon the concept of romanticism? I don\u2019t know.The constant traveling and exploring is another concept I really like about the book.

{"text": "\n           \n           The Fellowship of the Ring has been on my reading list for years. Like many others, I greatly enjoyed The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. (As a side note, I saw The Return of the King in the theater five times). I have been less enamored of the film adaptation(s) of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, but I haven't lost any of my love of the original trilogy. I'm glad to have started on my own personal journey to read Tolkien's source material.If you talk to just about anyone who has read The Lord of the Rings books they will all tell you how much they enjoyed the books and how dense and difficult they are. It's a huge barrier of entry for many readers, myself included, to explore Tolkien's world. It becomes very, very apparent very, very early on in the reading of The Fellowship that Tolkien loves the world he has created; its detail is entirely unmatched by any other fantasy book I have read thus far. It can also be totally superfluous to the story, which at times nearly brings the story to a grinding and unwelcome halt. I found myself intrigued by this fantastical world Tolkien had created with all of its geographic locations, historic monuments and events, and ages of time. It's overwhelming, and that's not always a good thing. Although I was intrigued with Tolkien's detailed world, whenever Tolkien did wander back to his story I remembered why I was actually reading the book.The story itself is a grand, albeit simple, adventure. It's a basic but bold story of good and evil. When the story was flowing I was enthralled and entertained. Having watched the films, it was a fun exercise to identify all of the areas and elements that were changed for the film adaptation. (Most of them, quite frankly, were desperately needed; perhaps more on that later). Tolkien's dialogue feels flat but can often be profound. Most of his characters are in desperate need of time\u2014time to speak, act, and generally be characters. With the amount of walking and waiting that goes on in the story, you would think Tolkien could have taken more advantage of the time he insists you spend with the characters to actually tell you more about them or better yet show you who they are. Instead, we\u2019re left with brief encounters and brief explanations of motivations. It leaves characters that should be three-dimensional stuck in a somewhat two-dimensional frame. The Fellowship of the Ring, along with the other books in the series, must be recognized for their contribution to literature and book genres in general. Tolkien created a living, breathing place, even if his characters don't do as much of those two things as they should. While reading about these magical places, I wanted to go to those places. An author can't accomplish a feeling like that without providing a commensurate amount of detail. However, there is a balance in setting a scene, creating a world, and telling a story. In The Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkien falters on the storytelling tight-rope. I will finish The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring, but I wanted to love it. I enjoy the Fantasy genre and feel it's only right to pay my dues to the monumental books that created it. Thus far, the story has been worth experiencing even if it sometimes feels like Tolkien's secondary concern. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "The Thousander Club", "stars": "3", "date": "May 05, 15", "likes": "0"},

{"text": "\n           \n           The Fellowship of the RingFor this month I read the first book in the series The Lord of the Ring, which is called the Fellowship of the Ring, written by J.R.R Tolkien. It is about a hobbit, a small human, named Frodo, who goes on an adventure to destroy the last ring before Sauron, the Dark Lord, collects them all. There, Frodo see all the dangers outside his hobbit hole. The theme of the book is you shouldn\u2019t be afraid of fear itself. Throughout the book, Frodo had to escape Sauron, which basically sucks in the light and lives all the horror and fear. When the black riders attack Frodo and his friends , his friends threw themselves on the ground, left with fear and horror. They needed to go to Mordor which is basically guarded by the evilest people you can imagine. One writing style Tolkien uses is very detailed descriptions. He uses that so readers can imagine the settings very clearly. It gives the readers a more interesting view of the book because then it is just like a real world. It makes the book seem like it's coming to life. A larger issue it might connect to is bullying. It slowly sucks out their fun and all they think about is what people think of them or what the people will do to them. A negative opinion on the book is that sometime he goes a little over the top with description. It is mostly great because it also describes the action, but after you read it a lot it gets a little boring. They live in a world full of fear. My advice to the readers is that they should know that the book is really good but it comes with a lot of details.

{"text": "\n           \n           The Fellowship of the Ring is told truthfully to how most adventures would happen: slow. Normally, I would get bored out of my mind trying to read a book as slow as The Fellowship of the Ring, but because of its vivid imagery, as well as great rhyming songs and poems, I was always interested, and thinking about what J.R.R. Tolkien was trying to foreshadow. The poems and songs were definitely my favorite part, because some were just lighthearted, as you might hear on a long, difficult journey, some were beautiful, glorifying scenery and characters, making them seem beautiful and mysterious, and some were serious, giving off the impression that something important was trying to be conveyed. Though I personally loved this book, and am even more excited to read the next books in the series, I would only recommend this book to be read by someone with a high attention span, or for it to be listened to on tape instead. Like The Hobbit, however, The Fellowship of the Ring lacked much character development, though it dived much deeper into the workings and reasons behind each and every part of the plot. Few books have peaked my interest as much as The Fellowship of the Ring, and though I have only read the beginning of the Lord of the Rings series, I feel that it has been given too much recognition for being such an amazing tale, and so far it isn\u2019t even in my top ten series, much less my favorite books. Finally, something that I wanted to add was that there is a huge amount of detail and intricacy in some areas that other areas are completely lacking of because Tolkien created the LOTR series to be a place where the elvish language (which has multiple dialects) could exist, which explains a lot about his style.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Ezra Zimmer", "stars": "3", "date": "Mar 02, 15", "likes": "0"},

Because of the difficulty Bilbo has in giving the ring away, his friend Gandalf the Grey suspects that the ring is more than it appears. Gandalf reveals to Frodo that the ring is in fact the One Ring, forged by Sauron the Dark Lord thousands of years before to enable him to dominate and enslave all of Middle-earth. Gandalf tells Frodo that the Ring must be destroyed to defeat Sauron's evil, but he also warns him that the Enemy has learned of the Ring's whereabouts from the creature Gollum and will seek to find it and kill its bearer. Despite the danger and hopelessness of the quest, Frodo accepts the burden and resolves to take the Ring to the safety of the elven stronghold of Rivendell.Frodo wakes in Rivendell, where the wise Elrond has worked his healing magic to save the hobbit. Frodo discovers that Bilbo, now grown very old, lives with the elves, and they reunite happily. Soon Elrond calls a council of the representatives of elves, men, and dwarves to respond to the growing darkness in the world. The council reviews the history of the Ring from its forging to the recent discovery that Frodo's ring is the One. Although Boromir, the representative of Gondor, the greatest kingdom of men, argues that the Ring should be used as a weapon against the Enemy, the Council resolves to destroy it. Someone must throw the Ring into the fires of Mount Doom, where it was first created, deep in Mordor, Sauron's country. Frodo accepts the task of carrying the Ring to Mordor, and a company is selected to help him on the quest: the wizard Gandalf; the men Boromir and Aragorn (known to Frodo as Strider but in fact the true king of Gondor); Legolas the elf; Gimli the dwarf; and Frodo's own hobbit kin, Merry, Pippin, and Sam. They are called the Fellowship of the Ring.The company considers several paths through the mountains, but the ways are all watched. Even if they did not have Sauron to fear, Saruman the White, once the wisest of the wizards, has allied himself with the Enemy and seeks the Ring for himself. When they attempt to cross the pass of Caradhras, an unnatural snowstorm nearly buries them, and they are forced to turn back. Finally, they resolve to brave the perilous dwarven Mines of Moria, now overrun by orcs and even darker things. Within Moria, Gollum begins following them. When the nine have nearly found their way out, they are attacked by orcs and a Balrog, a terrible demon. Gandalf holds it back so that the party can escape, but then he falls with it into the abyss.Devastated by the loss of Gandalf, the Fellowship flees to the elven wood of Lothl\u00f3rien. Lady Galadriel shelters them for a while and offers wise counsel. Frodo offers the Ring to Galadriel, but she resists the temptation. When the Fellowship leaves, she gives them boats to continue their journey down the river Anduin as well as more powerful gifts. Orcs attack them while traveling downriver, and they feel the presence of a winged Black Rider overhead, but they make it to the lawn of Parth Galen unharmed. There, they must decide whether to turn for Mordor and Mount Doom or to go to Minas Tirith, Boromir's home in Gondor. Boromir tries to force the issue by seizing the Ring from Frodo, but the hobbit escapes. Frodo resolves to set out alone for Mordor, reluctantly accepting Sam's steadfast refusal to stay behind.I would recommend this book to anyone because its is a very interesting and exciting story. The way it is written really connects you all of the characters in the story.

Some small differences--in the footnotes to the \"Merry Old Inn\" song, and the map in the hardcover is larger and more detailed. But it was the 1968 map that caught the imagination of a generation and spawned several thousand imitations. (I occasionally tried some cross-referencing in \"The Silmarillion,\" a book I've never actually gotten through.)Re-reading this, I was struck by Tolkien's occasional infelicities as a writer--subsidiary characters appear who are essentially names, and you remember them as names without knowing what they look like; whereas other characters, even minor ones, stay with you forever. I also remember, even back when I first read this at 11, my surprise at never really meeting Sauron. But after awhile you see this again and again; Denethor (steward of Gondor) and Theoden (King of Rohan) make almost cameo appearances here, as Gandalf recounts one of his adventures; they become major characters later, but they're \"introduced\" in a rather by-the-way fashion. At the same time, some of what Tolkien does is very subtle; for readers who came to the book from \"The Hobbit\" and might find it hard to transfer their devotion from Bilbo to Frodo, the older Hobbit is referenced continually as the Fellowship set out on their quest. It was also interesting to see how often these legendary characters speak \"realistically\" -- by which I mean, they'll make a dramatic statement but then qualify it. \"This will happen--unless of course things go differently and I'm mistaken, which could be.\" It adds to the sense that Something Big is happening all around and even the wisest are making things up as they go. And perhaps the biggest thing--the constant awareness of the good and the lovely and the joy and need of food and rest. There's a lot of walking in the book, it takes a long time to get from one place to another, and the daily requirements of eating and drinking and sleeping--and sightseeing--become as much a part of the story as anything else. Much of this is wound up in the nature of the Hobbits--- Tolkien's great creation, and the beings who put everything else in perspective. You can't help thinking of Thorin's dying words in \"The Hobbit\": \"If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold [or, one could add, rings of power and the desire to dominate others], it would be a merrier world.\" \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "James", "stars": "5", "date": "Feb 12, 15", "likes": "0"},
{"text": "\n           ** spoiler alert **\n            The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three volumes in The Lord of the Rings, an epic set in the fictional world of Middle-earth. The Lord of the Rings is an entity named Sauron, the Dark Lord, who long ago lost the One Ring that contains much of his power. His overriding desire is to reclaim the Ring and use it to enslave all of Middle-earth. The story of The Lord of the Rings begins with several events that take place in The Hobbit. While wandering lost in a deep cave, Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit\u2014one of a small, kindly race about half the size of Men\u2014stumbles upon a ring and takes it back with him to the Shire, the part of Middle-earth that is the Hobbits\u2019 home. All Bilbo knows of his ring is that wearing it causes him to become invisible. He is unaware that it is the One Ring, and is therefore oblivious to its significance and to the fact that Sauron has been searching for it. The Fellowship of the Ring opens with a party for Bilbo\u2019s 111th birthday. Bilbo gives his ring to his heir, his cousin Frodo Baggins. When the time comes to part with the ring, however, Bilbo becomes strangely reluctant to do so. He gives up the ring only at the determined urging of his friend, Gandalf the Grey, a great Wizard. Gandalf suspects that the ring is indeed the One Ring of legend. After confirming his suspicions, he tells Frodo that the Ring must be taken away from the Shire, as Sauron\u2019s power is growing once again. Frodo sets out from the Shire with three of his Hobbit friends\u2014Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Along the way, they are pursued by the nine Ringwraiths, servants of Sauron who take the form of terrifying Black Riders. The hobbits spend a night in the company of wandering Elves, who promise to send word ahead to friends who will protect the hobbits. Barely out of the Shire, the hobbits get lost in the Old Forest, where they have to be rescued from a malevolent willow tree, which swallows up Merry and Pippin, and then from an evil tomb ghost. The hobbits\u2019 rescuer is Tom Bombadil, a strange, jovial entity with great powers who is the oldest creature in Middle-earth. The hobbits make it to the town of Bree, where they meet Aragorn, a Ranger who roams the wilderness and who is the heir of the Kings of the ancient Men of Westernesse. Those who do not know Aragorn\u2019s true name call him Strider. Frodo tries to keep a low profile at the inn in Bree, but he ends up causing a scene when while taking part in a rollicking rendition of a song he falls, accidentally slips the Ring onto his finger, and vanishes.  The fact that the movies are a great achievement of movie-making is due, in part, to some of the changes that were required for screen adaptation. The most understandable differences in the screenplay from the story are those that were required to contract the duration of the film and keep up its pace. Even with substantial portions of the story excised in the screenplay, the three extended-edition movies have a combined running time of well over eleven hours, and there is arguably enough material not filmed to make a fourth extended-length motion picture. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Julien Chavez", "stars": "4", "date": "Mar 13, 15", "likes": "0"},

{"text": "\n           \n           Debate-ably one of the most influential writers in history, J.R.R Tolkien has formed a story so memorable that it is likely never to be forgotten. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three books in Tolkien's complete story \"The Lord of the Rings\". The book revolves around an all powerful, nearly indestructible ring, and the quest of the admirable creatures of Middle-Earth to vanquish it. A fellowship of nine members consisting of a wise wizard, two honor bound men, a fierce but friendly dwarf, and four courageous hobbits is created to deliver the ring back to the only place it can be destroyed: The fiery chasms of Mount Doom from which the Dark Lord Sauron created it. The fellowship's adventures across the danger filled land are wrought with peril, and its characters are to be deeply cared for as they experience the terrible hardships that are bound to such a journey.Tolkien's work would be recommended for an older or more experienced reading audience, as it is written with a complex and very detailed style that may take some a while to accustom to.

Chances are that if you've been alive for the past ten years you've at least heard of the Lord of the Rings, but if you've been living under a rock for the past 10 years, the basic premise is this, a hobbit, which is a small human looking creature with hairy feet, called Bilbo Baggins passes down all of his possessions to his nephew Frodo. Among the possessions is a magical ring with the ability to turn whoever wears it, invisible. It is later revealed by Gandalf the Grey, a powerful human wizard and close friend of Bilbo and Frodo, to be, \"The One Ring To Rule Them All\": a ring of immense power that turns whoever wields it for long periods of time to the side of evil. Frodo and Gandalf, along with other adventurers, then set out to destroy the Ring in the only place it can be destroyed: Mount Doom. Now the biggest problem I have with the book is that it feels like a giant set-up with no real payoff, which probably stems from the fact that it is only the first part of the book, and is just a setting up a glaring cliffhanger. For example, at the end, nothing is resolved. Now I recognize that naturally the first \"book\" isn't going to answer or resolve everything, but there should be at least some kind of payoff in the end instead of just an enormous \"TO BE CONTINUED\". The other big complaint I have is with the main character: Frodo. He's a boring young hero archetype: a wide-eyed innocent with a heart of gold forced out of his comfortable life to go on a dangerous adventure. He's also completely useless, and the only reason he even goes along is that he has the mystical \"One Ring\" and that no one else wants to risk exposure to the Ring's corruption. I realize that this archetype is used to emphasize Frodo's personal growth, but at the end, Frodo has very little growth, and I find myself laughing whenever Frodo suggests going alone to Mount Doom without his much more interesting and capable companions. So, in conclusion, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is fine if you want a history lesson on where current fantasy tropes come from, but just remember, it's all set-up with no payoff.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Franc Guzman", "stars": "2", "date": "Nov 28, 14", "likes": "0"},
{"text": "\n           \n           _Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings_ by J.R.R. Tolkien is the direct sequel to _The Hobbit_ that begins a world renowned trilogy. Occurring around sixty years after the original events, the story begins with Frodo Baggins inheriting a ring from his cousin Bilbo Baggins. This ring belongs to Sauron, the Dark Lord, who if he gets his hands on the ring, plans to enslave all of Middle Earth. Frodo has been chosen to destroy the ring at the Cracks of Doom, and sets out on his quest with some friends of his, to get away from Saurons guards who are pursuing the ring. On their journey to destroy the rings they get assigned a group of people by the council, and the group calls themselves the Fellowship of the Ring. on their journey the get caught in the town Riverdale, where they almost get captured by one of their pursuers. After this confrontation, Frodo decides that this journey is too dangerous for the group, and sneaks away to take the ring to the Cracks of Doom himself, but one of his friends, Sam, follows him and they continue the journey together.The movie is pretty similar to the book, which was directed by Steven Speilberg, and I feel like not much was lost in the movie adaptation of the book. I really appreciated this book because its a dark action story that tells a great story, and about how responsibility is a crucial component of life no matter what where you are. I believe responsibility is an ongoing struggle that people of all ages deal with, and the importance of it often gets over looked until a person like J.R.R. Tolkien uses it as the theme in a great work of art.

{"text": "\n           \n           In brief, this is the story of physically and mentally weak half-humans who have willingly submitted themselves to the tyranny of societal obligation. The story begins with capitalist hero Bilbo Baggins planning a lavish birthday party for himself and his freeloading nephew Frodo. Every half-human in the village is invited to behold the greatness of Bilbo's wealth, and Bilbo calls in all his markers, even securing the services of a wizard, to ensure that the lazy villagers are suitably impressed. At the party our hero hands out extravagant gifts to all his guests, which on the surface may seem an altruistic misstep, but in actuality is a brilliant way for Bilbo to impress upon his inferiors just how much better he is than they. He then proceeds to give a speech in which he cleverly insults everyone, then disappears, thereby ensuring that he gets the last laugh. At this point of the novel I am still a fan of Bilbo; he is a rich half-man who has learned how to live his life for himself and use his vast wealth to get what he wants when he wants it. The other mediocre half-humans envy his power and importance, and like all Takers try to elevate the value of their mediocrity so as to devalue Bilbo's greatness. But Bilbo has stood strong against their vile attempts to tear him down for sixty-odd years, laughing in their pitiful faces all that time. I have only one small worry; Bilbo's soft spot for his do-nothing nephew.After the party we discover that Bilbo plans to leave the village forever, and to bequeath his vast personal fortune to Frodo, who has done nothing to earn it. All he plans to keep is one small ring. While packing Bilbo is confronted by the wizard Gandalf, who forces him to leave the ring to Frodo. All my respect for Bilbo is now gone. Not only has he given everything he owns to his lazy nephew, but he has also allowed himself to be dominated by someone else's will. On the other hand I feel that Gandalf has potential; the way he used his great personal power to break Bilbo's will impressed me. Sadly this impression would not last.Bilbo is now gone from the story, and it is at this point that we begin our journey with the pathetic Frodo. To be brief about it Frodo discovers that the ring his uncle left him is in fact extraordinarily powerful, and instead of taking that power for himself he decides to travel with his friends, Sam, Merry, and Perry, to the collectivist enclave of Riverdell, where the fate of the ring, Frodo's personal property, will be decided by people who have no ownership claim to it. Along the way they run into trouble and have to be saved by the powerful hippie Thomas Bombadil. Bombadil refuses to journey with the half-humans, presumably because he needs to tend to his marijuana plants, and thankfully we never see him again. Before the group reaches Riverdell we are introduced to two more characters of note; Aragorn, a failure constantly whining about about his family's lost glory rather than making something of himself, and Glorfindel, an incredibly powerful elf. Once at Riverdell Frodo bows to the demands of a council of bureaucrats, who decide that the ring of power should be destroyed. Why this should be done is never clearly explained; all we are given is some leftist jibber-jabber about the corrosive nature of power. A group of disparate persons, the titular fellowship, is chosen to take the ring to a volcano and throw it in. Startlingly Glorfindel is not chosen to be in this group, though the much less powerful elf Legoland is. Only one person from amongst this fellowship is in any way intriguing. Boromir is the prince of some place or other, and he wants to use the ring to destroy his enemies. Of course the pantywaists who comprise the rest of the fellowship shout him down. They would rather see the ring destroyed than allow Boromir, or anyone else, to achieve personal power and distinguish themselves from the pedestrian masses.What follows in an insipid and uninspired story of weak-willed people constantly sacrificing themselves on the alter of the Greater Good. Only one character, the ostensible antagonist Sauron, acts in his own rational self-interest, while we the readers are treated to several hundred pages of disturbingly short-sighted protagonists and their na\u00efvely altruistic philosophies. One can only hope that as this story continues into the next two novels, which I will not read, Frodo will finally wake up and utilize the ring for his own personal profit, or failing that, Sauron will regain the ring, which belonged to him originally, and destroy those who oppose him. Likely though the story will not end that way. How exactly it will end I do not know, or care to know. What I do know however is this: if Bilbo had left the ring to the Sackville-Bagginses instead of his worthless nephew Frodo none of us would have had to suffer through this travesty.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Larry Greatman", "stars": "1", "date": "Dec 09, 14", "likes": "0"},

{"text": "\n           \n            The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien, is a fiction piece and is the beginning to the very popular Lord of the Rings series of novels. Throughout the story many themes present itself, but the one that I feel generally presents itself is heroism. Not just your plain old hero that is expected to just save the day no matter what, I think that the main theme is finding a hero in the most unexpected places. J.R.R. Tolkien has also published The Hobbit, which is a prelude to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. This fantasy work of fiction takes place in a world called, Middle-Earth. Many different races live there, but the main ones are men, dwarves, elves, orcs, and what this book is largely concerning, hobbits. Frodo Baggins is a hobbit that lives in a place called the Shire and is a somewhat respectable hobbit. He is the heir of Bilbo Baggins who left to explore the world again and left behind a very dangerous object. This object is the Ring of Power that once belonged to the evil Sauron that was cast away many years ago. Sauron now knows of its existence and sends his servants, Black Riders, to try to retrieve the ring from Frodo so he can conquer Middle-Earth. Now Frodo, along with his companions goes on an epic journey to destroy the Ring of Power in the only place it can be destroyed, Sauron\u2019s dark kingdom.  I feel that overall I find this novel interesting, entertaining, and memorable. Throughout the story we are thrust into Frodo\u2019s world of constantly being on the run from incredible dangers, and while this may not be exciting for Frodo, it is very entertaining to us. In some parts though, mainly the beginning, the journey is a little slow paced, and in some parts it seems like he spends a whole thirty page chapter on some part of the journey that really doesn\u2019t seem relevant. J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s opinions throughout the book show us that he believes that courage, and heroism can come from the most unexpected of people. Take Frodo\u2019s friend, Sam, as an example. He was just a simple gardener before he left the Shire, but now he is willing to risk his life to save his friend, Frodo, from anything. I agree with Tolkien\u2019s opinion because I think that everyone his courage and bravery inside them. Even though it may not seem like it, most people would do anything to protect the people they love, and I think that Tolkien conveys this perfectly. This opinion is also shown in many other books like Eragon, which is a story of a poor farm boy, who even though doesn\u2019t seem like a hero, ends up saving the day in the end. For me this topic/theme really hit me to heart because it taught me that even though people may not expect greatness out of you, you can prove them wrong because everyone has potential, it\u2019s just that there are some people that seek it out, and seem that don\u2019t even try.  To wrap this up I would recommend The Fellowship of the Ring to anyone that loves a good fantasy read. It is one of my favorite fantasy novels I have read and I am sure you will enjoy it. The only thing I can harp on is that some parts do drag on too far, even though they aren\u2019t really relevant, but I encourage you to keep on reading because it really does get pretty good after a few chapters and if you give it a chance, I think most people will like this book. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Alyssa", "stars": "4", "date": "Jan 14, 15", "likes": "0"},
{"text": "\n           \n           The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R.Tolken, has a simple story line the spans through three books. The Plot of the book series is that Frodo needs to get to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. The one message that can be interpreted by the author is that it is to keep a promise. This message is proved in that Frodo is asked by Gandalf to deliver the ring to mount doom and the Frodo\u2019s friends\u2019 promise to be by his side on the journey there. A quote that supports this is that Lord Elrond: \u201cYou at least shall go with him\u201d (294) and later same and Frodo had this conversation \u201cFrodo: I am going to Mordor. Sam: I know that well enough Mr. Frodo, but I\u2019m coming with you\u201d (397) which shows that he is keeping his promise to stay with Frodo till the end.This book was very entertaining in that it allowed me to see the adventure of young Frodo Baggins through a mythical land of Middle Earth. It dealt with an evil that is looming over the land and wants to rule it unless it\u2019s stopped and that the people that are going to stop it are some hobbits that have never ventured outside their shire. This book (and series) completely changed how I read books. It change me in that it gave me a fantasy world that I wanted to know about and see how it worked. It gave me a new passion to read books so I could find how the look and what rule they have.This book is a slow read, but it is worth it because it is an adventure through its series.

I read it alone the first time, to my older children the next time, to my younger children the third time, and over again three more times spanning several decades. Tolkien's invention of the Elvish language and its sparing but poignant use in the series adds gravitas to the epic. Separately, Tolkien created eons of back-story to color the mythical background in precisely selected small swatches, and the whole is documented in the Silmarillion, which I urge you to Google after reading the series. I simply dove into the Hobbit and swam through The Lord of the Rings without any such preparation, and I recommend that you don't need such preparation either. Even if you've seen the movies, as a book lover you know you'll enter Tolkien's world and participate in the adventures through the books--rather than just viewing it from the outside in the movies.

This particular book, the fellowship of the ring, the epic sequel to the The Hobbit is nothing less than his finest. Enough praising. The book begins a little slow, as Tolkien decides that lore is very important and that we definitely should have to read 100 pages of it, though it does grant you a greater understanding of the world and a tighter grasp of the history of the characters and their family trees and whatnot, ultimately allowing you to enjoy the book to the fullest extent. Once the actual story starts, it becomes an addictive journey of a hobbit, a wizard, a dwarf, and elf, a man, and a half man half elf which only becomes better as go along.

And indeed it is: one of his uncle's possessions, a mysterious ring, is actually a relic from a bygone age, coveted by the dark lord Sauron, and it has mystical powers to make the wearer invisible as well as warp the wearer's mind. Its previous owner, Gollum, has been captured and tortured, revealing the new owner of the ring, so Gandalf expects evil to arrive in Frodo's sweet little Hobbit neighborhood. Frodo is urged to flee to Rivendell, an elf city, where the ring should be safe and where they will decide what to do with the ring so it does not fall into enemy hands.But when Frodo makes his plans to leave and Gandalf does not come to escort him, he and his party of hobbits set out anyway, having a couple misadventures and meeting Tom Bombadil of the forest on the way (remember, his boots are yellow!). Soon they meet Strider, who says he's with Gandalf and offers to take them the rest of the way to Rivendell. But when they get attacked by creepy servants of the dark lord, Frodo is injured and in danger of a terrifying transformation. Luckily, he has powerful friends; Glorfindel and Elrond, elves of Rivendell, help them escape and help Frodo to heal. When he is well enough, many important folks convene for a council in Elrond's home, and they discuss the coming war; Saruman, once an ally of Gandalf, is now attempting to get the ring for himself, and an orc army is going to come their way. Also searching for the ring are several other parties, including Gollum, who has escaped. Frodo, because of his good heart and willingness, is chosen to bear the ring, and he will be accompanied by eight others--Gandalf, Legolas the elf, Gimli the dwarf, Aragorn (who introduced himself as Strider, the ranger), Boromir the son of Gondor's steward, and his three hobbit pals Sam, Merry, and Pippin. They will go off to destroy the ring in the lava it came from--right under Sauron's nose in Mordor.The journey is long and snowy, and they are attacked by wolf-like creatures, so they duck into the mines of Moria--dwarf country. Gimli is excited that he will get to travel in familiar terrain and find out what happened to some of his kin, but evil creatures have infiltrated, and they come for the Fellowship. Gandalf fights--and seems to lose--a battle with an ancient demonic creature called a Balrog, and they fall off a cliff. The rest escape, heartbroken, and are led to Lothl\u00f3rien--an elf dwelling. They meet Celeborn and Galadriel--ancient elves of great power who know of their mission and give them important gifts to help them. But when the ring's sweet power begins to tempt one of the Fellowship members, Frodo grieves and worries that it's too dangerous to suck everyone into this. He and Sam travel on alone, on their way to Mordor.As you can see from my synopsis, this is a complex story with a huge cast. It's epic, with a pretty narrow focus on a few travelers when compared to the huge war their actions are affecting, and it's a treat to read something so ambitious, so broad, so well fleshed out. I've sometimes said that despite the \"over\"-described scenery and inclusion of a ridiculous number of poems and verses, it sort of feels like you're listening to a master storyteller sitting by a fire, and he tells it so evocatively that you feel you were there (because he sure was!), but sometimes aspects of it that you don't think are significant trickle in and you've got to listen because it's all part of the package. You feel you're so invested in this story and its world that you're okay with it if the guy telling it has to break into song once in a while as he sips his ale, you know? The breadth and depth of this world is really something special, and despite the lack of connection to characters in the storytelling, I really enjoyed reading it. It's an investment, though.

{"text": "\n           \n           This book is one for those who love tales of adventure, mystery, and suspense. J.R.R. Tolkien manages, in The Fellowship of the Ring, to create a story of just this by telling the tale of young Frodo Baggins and his travels, with other hobbits Sam, Merry, and Pippin, of fighting wraiths in the form of Black Riders, avoiding assassination, and eventually leaving behind everything in order to save everyone from the corruption of the ring. Overall this was a good book but it, like all the others, had flaws. Though the book was good it moved to fast in the beginning. For those who read this book before The Hobbit, you will agree that readers did not get a good enough look into Bilbo Baggins. After one chapter of being introduced to Bilbo Baggins, he leaves without much explanation and leaving readers wondering much about Bilbo. Bilbo should have been given a deeper look into before he left in the beginning.I love action but after Bilbo left to much happened too quickly. Many years passed in a matter of two chapters without explanation then a not so long and perilous journey took up the remaining chapters. Along the way Frodo and his fellowship are attacked by wraiths and a malevolent willow tree, nearly get trapped in a ghost tomb, accidentally expose the ring, nearly get killed in the inn they were staying in, again face the wraiths, Frodo nearly gets killed when someone tries to take the ring, then Frodo and Sam leave the group and head for Mordor just in time for the book to end.The book-to-movie adaption was decent,but as always there were flaws to create a more film-like feeling. In the beginning of the book Bilbo uses the ring to disappear, but Gandalf adds some special effects to hide Bilbo's use of the ring; but the movie depicts Bilbo just disappearing inexplicably. Another simple and unneeded change was that the sword of Narsil was broken into two pieces in the book versus six pieces in the movie. The movie also cut out some chapters, but it obviously did not effect the story line muchThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was an okay book with flaws that could be pardoned by some people. These flaws include the lack of much needed description of beloved character Bilbo Baggins and the uneven passing of time in this book. Now imagine if this book was just a little longer because it was more descriptive and spent more time on each event. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Brittany Helmholtz", "stars": "3", "date": "Oct 03, 14", "likes": "0"},

I say unfortunately of course because as you may have noticed I am just now writing my review.

Well I'm intensely in love with this series all anew. I am a few books behind in my yearly reading challenge so it was a risk to take the time to read a longer story and one that has patches of language so dense it often takes me a couple of tries to get the entire grasp of the paragraph. It was a snap decision and boy am I glad of it, I've loved revisiting middle earth and bringing my older eyes to some of my favorite moments in the saga.One of my favorite things about Tolkien is the humor and the poetry that don't seem to have a place in such a standout epic fantasy but somehow elevate it anyhow. Whenever a character drops a wisecrack or cues up to deliver a carefully thought out chant that they are supposed to have come up with on the spot. I love that about Tolkien just like I love it when Aragorn fells a Goblin Chieftain or Gandalf says something quoteably wise.To me this book represents the feeling of joy I get from LOTR.

{"text": "\n           \n           Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien is the first book I have read by J.R.R. Tolkien. This novel is set in an imaginary place called Middle Earth. Tolkien took great care in developing Middle Earth and its various languages. These languages were developed through his study of Old English, Anglo-Saxon, and Welsh poetry.The Fellowship is the nine main characters through the series. The Fellowship is designed to destroy Sauron\u2019s ring. Sauron is the antagonist and created the ring to hold some of his evil powers. The ring is so strong that anyone who wears it for an extended period of time begins to change into a more evil version of themselves and want the power the ring holds. This aspect of the ring comes into play throughout the series. The members of The Fellowship are: Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee (commonly referred to as Sam), Gandalf the Grey, Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, Boromir, Peregrin Took (Pippin), and Meriadoc Brandybuck (Merry). In addition to the fellowship are other key characters. Ringwraiths were originally nine mortal kings, but Sauron gave them nine rings which turned them into his servants once Sauron created his own ring. They are now immortal and can only be seen by Sauron and whoever is wearing Sauron\u2019s ring. They constantly bother Frodo on his quest to destroy the ring in Mordor at Mount Doom. Gollum (formerly Smeagol) is proof of the ring\u2019s corruptive power. He killed his friend, Deagol, after Deagol found the ring at the bottom of a river. The ring corrupted Smegol and changed him into his current form. He has the ring until he loses it in the Misty Mountains, which is where Bilbo finds it. Bilbo Baggins, as mentioned above, finds the ring in the Misty Mountains and has it until his 111th birthday party where he tries to give it to his cousin, Frodo.The plot begins as aforementioned with Bilbo\u2019s 111th birthday party and him considering giving the ring to Frodo. Thankfully, Gandalf realizes that the ring is Sauron\u2019s ring, and forces him to hand it over. Gandalf says that the ring needs to be taken away from the Shire because Sauron\u2019s power is growing. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin begin the journey to Mordor. They begin to travel and are attacked by Ringwraiths. From there, they make it to Bree, where they meet Aragorn (sometimes referred to as Strider). Aragorn saves their lives by telling them not to sleep in their rooms at the inn in Bree. They are attacked by Riders, and Frodo gets hurt. Elrond, the master of Rivendell, heals Frodo and then holds a meeting to figure out what to do with the ring. The Fellowship of the Ring is created and the goal is to destroy the ring in Mordor at Mount Doom.One of my favorite quotes is, \u201cIt is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing,\u201d by Boromir. This stood out to me while reading because it captures the essence of the quest. This story is not about destroying a ring, it\u2019s about the power of good and evil and resisting temptation. The novel shows humanity\u2019s weaknesses by creating a fictional world with fictional characters. I like this quote because it shows how the book applies to life.As a major Harry Potter fan, I noticed similarities between The Fellowship\u2019s quest to destroy the ring and Harry\u2019s quest to destroy the horcruxes and find the hallows. The main connection is that the ring contains a part of Sauron\u2019s evil, which is similar to the horcruxes containing part of Voldemort\u2019s soul. Also, both are very hard to destroy and can have negative effects on the person wearing them. Examples of this are Smeagol\u2019s transformation to Gollum and the horcrux making Ron leave the others during their quest to find the horcruxes. Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring is a great story, guaranteed to keep the reader engaged with all of the adventures and danger of the quest. I felt like I was the 10th member of The Fellowship!

{"text": "\n           \n           The Fellowship of the Ring is written by J. R. R. Tolkien. This was the first book I read by this author. The first character is the Dark Lord Sauron who had created the ring to help him conquer all of Middle-earth. He is an evil wizard searching for his ring. Ever since the ring was created, there has been a War of the Ring, where Ringwraiths, evil minions, attempt to gain the control and power of the ring to give back to Dark Lord Sauron. The main character, a hobbit named Frodo Baggins, found the ring one day and used it to his advantage. Gandalf, a wizard and mentor, warned him of the evil things that could come after him while he was in possession of the ring. Frodo, Gandalf, and their companions agree that the ring must be destroyed so no one could abuse its power. This begins their journey to a volcano in Mordor to destroy the ring forever. The first book of this series is mainly about their journey traveling to Mordor and the evil creatures that are trying to kill them for the ring. \tOne of the principal characters is Frodo Baggins. He is a hobbit that is sociable with the other characters and curious about his surroundings. Frodo seemed weak at first, having to rely on the ring many times to get him out of trouble. This character affects the story by having the ring and using its powers, which created the whole story. I emphasized with Frodo at first, because I took pity in his weakness, but I grew frustrated when he continued to use the ring for help when told not to. Another character was Gandalf, the wizard. Gandalf is a mentor and friend to Frodo and others. He\u2019s the one who decided that the ring needed to be destroyed. Gandalf affected the story because he was the leader of the elves, hobbits, and others throughout the journey. Gandalf was one of my favorite characters because he was the wisest. None of his decisions in the novel seemed foolish. The last character is the Dark Lord Sauron who created the ring. He is doing everything he can to get it back, since it holds all his power. He and Gandalf are complete opposites when it comes to desires for the ring. He affects the story by creating an evil force for the fellowship to race against. I did not emphasize with this character, because he is portrayed as being evil. \tOne theme that stood out is the control of dangerous knowledge. The dangerous knowledge is the power of the ring and what it could cause. This contributes to the work by creating more meaning to the ring and what it represents. Another theme is the powers of good versus evil. This contributes to the book by creating tension and suspense to make the novel more interesting to the readers. These themes are effective because they create more depth to the story, which helps the reader connect emotionally. This novel is accessible to all readers, but I would suggest it to readers who like more fantasy than anything else. The Fellowship of the Ring appealed to me in both an emotional and logical way. It appealed to me in an emotional way because the Ringwraiths were going after the fellowship and it caused to me care for the well being of the fellowship, knowing they could be harmed or even killed. The novel appealed to me in a logical way because the author set up a different fantasy world with its own rules and society that I was trying to understand while reading the book. Overall, The Fellowship of the Ring was engaging and exciting. I would definitely read the rest of the series. \t\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Catherine Bowling", "stars": "4", "date": "Mar 24, 14", "likes": "0"},

When I was younger, I made an attempt at The Hobbit by the same author, J.R.R. Tolkien , and...failed. So I am actually surprised I made it through this book. The beginning is the hardest to make it through because it's very slow and you're trying to absorb all of the complex names of people and places.

One of my favorite quotes is said by Gandalf in chapter 10, \"All that is gold does not glitter,Not all those who wander are lost...\". It's kinda a spin on the phrase \"all that glitters isn't gold\", I think. So basically, what Tolkien is trying to teach us many lessons here. The most important I think is that what is the best is not always obvious to us and that we can not assume things based on appearance There were some major differences between the book and the movie and one of the ones that shocked me the most was that Frodo began his journey when he was 50...about the same age as Bilbo when he started his journey; quite a difference from the young lad in the movie. Also, in the movie, Frodo practically leaves right after Bilbo's 111th birthday party. But in the book, he waits around almost 2 decades before opportunity knocks...aka Gandalf...at his front door.It's a great book and I highly recommend it!

{"text": "\n           \n           This is the first book I have read from this series, and I must say I am thoroughly impressed. The story tells the adventures of a young hobbit, a small human-like creature from a place known as the Shire. His uncle, Bilbo Baggins, leaves behind a gold ring, the last ring of power. This ring is a blessing and a curse for Frodo, but mostly the later. It is a very rare item, as it is the only one of its kind. However, it is constantly being hunted by evil creatures known as the Ringwraiths. Frodo must carry the ring to Mount Doom, the place where the ring was first created. He is accompanied by a small party of warriors, hobbits, an elf, and a dwarf. \tThe Fellowship of the Ring was a great book, but be warned: it is a very long book and is not the easiest of reads! It tops off at 398 pages, a hefty novel for even the most avid readers. However, the length is greatly appreciated due to the amazing amount of detail the author provides. All the descriptions really help immerse you in the story, throwing you into dark places in the fearful scenes, while really making you appreciate the beauty of the forest of the elves. \tThe major theme I noticed was that of temptation. Throughout the entire story, the ring is constantly whispering in Frodo\u2019s ear, trying to get him to wear the ring so the Ringwraiths can find and kill him. It seemed like a huge Biblical allusion to me, with Frodo being an allusion to Jesus and Sauron being Satan. Sauron even sounds like Satan! The plot alludes to Jesus trying to eliminate the danger for others, him through sacrifice, Frodo through basically a suicide mission. The fellowship represents the disciples, as they follow Frodo/Jesus on the mission. \tOverall The Fellowship of the Ring was a great novel, with action and peril at every turn. As stated before, it is a very long read, making it a little less appealing when trying to read it while juggling other school assignments. That being said, it is completely worth your time to read it all the way through.

{"text": "\n           \n           The world of Middle Earth is quite possibly the most developed fantasy world out there. JRR Tolkien wrote a truly great trilogy when he crafted the Lord of The Rings Trilogy. The first installment, The Fellowship of the Ring, presents readers with a young hobbit named Frodo, who is presented with a quest that is, quite literally, much larger than himself. He is given a ring by his Uncle, Bilbo. This ring proves to be much more trouble than Bilbo thought. As it turns out, an ancient dark lord created the ring to give him power over nineteen other rings, which were forged for leaders of the Human, Elvish, and Dwarvish, races. Frodo now has to run from Ringwraiths, fight hundreds of orcs and find his way to Mt. Doom in Mordor in order to rid himself of the ring. He must do all of this without getting captured by the dark lord, Sauron. That\u2019s a lot to handle for one little hobbit.Needless to say, Frodo gets help from many characters along the way, including Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, and no one can forget Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Sam, Merry, and Pippin are fairly straightforward folks. They are hobbits that accompany Frodo on his journey. The others all have a much more complicated past. Aragorn/Strider is very mysterious and knows a lot more than any simple ranger should. Gandalf, of course is a brilliant and powerful wizard with a long history. Legolas and Gimli are are the elvish and dwarvish representatives in the Fellowship. They bring their own knowledge and skills to the table. Then there\u2019s Boromir. Boromir is a human from Gondor, who doesn\u2019t really want the ring to be destroyed. He thinks it would be better to use the ring in the coming war against Sauron\u2019s forces.I loved this book. The plot and characters were very well developed. There were so many twists in the plot that it was nearly impossible to predict. There\u2019s lots of action, magic, and mysteries that are deeply intertwined with the overall story. The one thing that I didn\u2019t particularly like is that there were a few places where Tolkien put in lots of descriptions and information that seemed either unnecessary or redundant.

Action, fantasy, adventure, mythology, and hobbits; what more could you as for? This first book in a group of three (trilogy) is about a young hobbit named Frodo Baggins and his journey to Mordor to destroy the ring given to him by Bilbo Baggins. The only way to destroy this ring (a ring of great evil) is to send it into the fires of Mt. Doom, the place of the ring's origin. Frodo is set to travel across Middle Earth, from the Shire to Mordor, and destroy the ring with the help of eight companions. These nine are consisted of four hobbits, one elf, one dwarf, two men, and a wizard.  The nine are challenged with working together to deliver the ring to Mt. Doom. Things aren't always as easy as they seem. Despite having the same goal, the group sometimes disagrees on the road to take to reach that goal.  This book was great, I loved reading into the story and just letting my mind go wild. I do have two problems with the book though, first is the length. Now I know creating an entire new, universe it almost seems, takes a lot of explaining but the book did seem a little wordy. Maybe it was because I had to read this while juggling a barrage of Spanish essays and projects (I'm not that good at Spanish) but I just sort of wanted to skip a page or two because I wanted to get to the more interesting parts. Don't get me wrong, I've already said before, I love the way it was written, just could have done with maybe 350 pages.  The second and final complaint I have is Tom Bombadil!!!! Does anybody know where I can learn more about this man because he seems so interesting. Why wasn't he given any more background? Why was he just thrown into the book with, at least in my opinion, no importance to the plot. He just put on the ring, laughed a bit, and then saw Frodo wearing the ring as if he didn't have the ring on. How was he able to do that? Is Tom older than the ring itself, therefore powerful enough to dispel its powers? There are so many unanswered, frustrating, questions I have about him it's not even funny. Sorry about that rant, just had to get it off my chest. Anyways The Fellowship of the Ring was a great book.

When you consider that there is a party, consisting of four Hobbits, a Wizard, an Elf, a Dwarf and two men, setting out on a quest, you expect a great deal of adventure. After all, Tolkien did it in the Hobbit. Unfortunately most of the book was taken up with descriptions of the landscape: trees, streams, etc. There is one sentence in chapter seven of book two (the Mirror of Galadriel) which sums a lot of it up; it goes, \"it seemed to them that they did little but eat and drink and rest, and walk among the trees\". Alas, this sums the book up quite well. Given the cast of characters assembled, one would have expected more adventure.I think the problem with 'the Fellowship' is that it is not one story in a great collection of three stories, but one third of a bigger story. I had already purchased the three books in the one volume, I just hope the others are an improvement.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "I.

{"text": "\n           \n           Since watching Battle of Five Armies, I've been on a quest of my own to immerse myself in the world of Tolkien. Reading the Lord of The Rings trilogy, at last, is key to that immersion. There are many things I liked about the first volume: the well-written action and landscapes; the dramatic dialogue that sometimes seems to be written to be performed; the rich exploration of each land Frodo and his Company travel through; and details omitted from the Jackson movie that raise the profile of Merry and Pippin, in particular, to more than just comic relief; and ultimately, the fundamental tension between good and evil in the world and in all of us. The only thing I tired of somewhat, was the re-use of the time lapse mechanism at various points in the book and the uneven handling of the characters. That said, I still enjoyed the book very much. Having first seen the movie, and now read the book, I find that reading the book has filled out the story for me quite satisfyingly.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Maritza Heuvel", "stars": "4", "date": "Mar 08, 15", "likes": "0"},
{"text": "\n           \n           For someone who thought the pacing was slow, I get the feeling Tolkien was in no great hurry to be anywhere, I've read this a few times, more so to see if I wasn't missing anything. Tolkiens World Building is incredible, I read the history of Middle Earth book and am awestruck and amazed by this man's incredible imagination for building this epic world and entirely new history, the world building and history are beyond the human imagination. Many have tried Robert Jordan and George RR Martin created their own breath taking worlds, inspired by Tolkien and their own imaginative talents but nothing to me personally and I know others like the epic world that is Middle Earth. Yes I am that person who preferred the movies over the books, saw them in theaters when they first came out (wow was it that long ago) and had the box Set on DVD) I'm a huge fan of the movies its the book that I'm not fan boying. I do think Tolkien also created amazing creatures. The Elves, The Hobbits etc. I like to keep my reviews spoiler free and focus more on what I thought of the book rather than give a complete synopsis besides if you are reading a review on this book you've probably looked at the synopsis provided you don't already know it. Also no matter how hugely popular a book or movie series is not everyone has read this book and there are always new readers, young and old who will pick up this book for the first time. I loved the friendship and the loyalty between Frodo and Sam, I've read the songs but I felt like I could have skipped them. Great world building is there a Deux Ex Machina? (aka Dogs Eggs Machine a) Yes there is but I'll let the reader figure it out, I read the songs but I felt like they didn't need to be on every other page. Tolkien spend long abouts of time describing in detail things that he could have left to my imagination I really was not a fan of the long out descriptions. Read this book for the world, the history.

It is the One Ring, crafted by Sauron, who desired to dominate all things in the world.

On there quest, which the world depends on, they meet new friends and enemies, and face many dangers.\tI can think of so many reasons why the Lord of the Rings is a great book. One is that it tells a classic story of good versus evil. This book reminds us that even in real life, there are those who will always fight evil simply because it is the right thing to do, like Frodo does. Another reason this book is great is that it has the best imagery I have ever read.

{"text": "\n           \n            The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R Tolkien is the first book of a trilogy of books. The adventure, started in The Hobbit, continues 60 years later with a hobbit named Frodo Baggins, who is the nephew of the star of The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. The story begins with the hobbit Bilbo Baggins having a birthday party. However, a sudden disappearance of Bilbo reveals, to at least the wizard Gandalf, that not everything is as it seems. Gandalf convinces Bilbo to give the magic ring that he possessed ever since his adventures in The Hobbit, and to give that ring to Frodo before he leaves. soon after Gandalf leaves Frodo, but gives warning to Frodo to not use the ring, showing that Gandalf suspects its sinister nature. Indeed, when Gandalf returns to Frodo, years later, it is revealed, through a test of fire, that the magic ring that Bilbo possessed for many long years, was the One Ring, created by the Dark Lord Sauron and Sauron will do anything to get his ring back. Gandalf then sends Frodo away from his home, the Shire, to try to prevent Sauron from getting his hands on it. Gandalf tells Frodo to make for Rivendell, a hidden place inhabited by elves, who would help. Gandalf then leaves again to take council, and Frodo leaves the Shire with three other hobbits, Sam Gamgee, Merry and Pippin.  The four hobbits go through many adventures to get to Rivendell. When they reach Bree, about halfway through their journey, things become more difficult. It is clear that someone or something has been following them. It turns out to be multiple things, as revealed to them by a ranger called Strider. the hobbits are told that Ringwraiths, hunters of the ring sent by Sauron, are after them. To escape, the hobbits take on Strider to be their guide to Rivendell. in an attempt to shake off their pursuers, the group makes for Weathertop and are there attacked. The hobbits and Strider are then desperate to get to Rivendell, for Frodo was poisoned by the Ringwraiths. After a series of obstacles, the party gets to Rivendell, and Frodo is cured. However, despite what Gandalf promised, it is decided in a council that the Ring could not stay in Rivendell. It is decided that the ring has to be destroyed, because if it is not destroyed, the peoples of Middle-earth, the men, hobbits, elves and dwarves, are all in danger. Frodo then resolves to take the ring to the one place it can be destroyed: Mount Doom, which is located deep into enemy territory, the heart of Sauron's domain. However, Frodo is not going alone. with him are going his three hobbit friends, who were with him for the start of his journey, Strider, who is revealed to be Aragorn, the king of Gondor, Gandalf, the wizard, Boromir, a man of Gondor who came to the council for counsel, Legolas, an Elf from the forests of Mirkwood and son of the king of Mirkwood elves, and Gimli, a dwarf form the Lonely Mountain and son of one of Bilbo's companions in The Hobbit. Together, these nine are to take the ring through the lands of Middle-earth and reach Mordor, Sauron's domain. They will have many more adventures, and so as not to spoil the rest of the book, I will say no more except this: this book is one of a trilogy, so the adventure will not be finished until the end of the third book. I really enjoyed this book. This book was an improvement on The Hobbit because it was filled with more information. J.R.R Tolkien did a very good job explaining the different areas that the company traversed, the dialogue that connected you to the characters, and the different languages used by Tolkien to add more depth to the story. The book made you want to keep reading either because you wanted to get to a certain point, or the book was too hard to put down. The book was good, however it took a very long time for any of the action to start. The beginning is full of dialogue, which makes you get to know the characters, but it makes the beginning very boring. it is not until the ninth or tenth chapter that you really know for sure what is going on, and the actions starts to heat up. Still most of the actions completed by characters other than Frodo and his companions are not revealed until the Council of Elrond. After that time though, the book is really good and full of action. It also, at this point, makes it possible to learn more about the other races of Middle-earth, particularly the Elves and Dwarves. Still, there are a few other points in the book that are just better to skip through, for they are no more than songs. Tolkien included songs and rhymes created by the different races for different subjects, but these songs seem to me just to fill up the pages, and are pretty dull. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that reads, because it is such a good book. However, not all people would be able to read this book. Specifically, the people who should read it are people who are good at reading, love to read, love fantasy novels and like a realistic story. Still, it think it would be good for people to read it at least once in their lives. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Cheyenne", "stars": "5", "date": "Feb 18, 14", "likes": "0"},

{"text": "\n           \n           The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien is the successor and the inception of the Lord of the Rings series. I personally consider it be one of the founding novels for fantasy and sci-fi books that we have today, containing all of the rudimentary aspects and criteria of a fantasy/sci-fi novel: Drama, action, and creatures of the unimaginable. In this novel, the reader is brought into a world of elves and Orks, where beasts of legend thrive and conquer kingdoms and people. But in amidst of the battles, lies an object that can change the balance of Good and Evil; A ring, so precious and powerful that the bravest of men fall and kingdoms clash before the ring. When tensions rise and the stakes are at it's highest, the reader is left to ask, To it's roots, is man good or evil?J.R.R. Tolkien has achieved to creating a complex and diverse world where the reader is not limited to what is written on the page. In my opinion, the author meets all of the criteria of making a \"good\" book, such as a unique and eye-catching plot, unexpected turn of events, interesting characters, and a comprehensive storyline. But what makes this book so interesting, is the moral. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you what it is, for in order to find out, you must read this book yourself.With its deep morals and fascinating characters and settings, I recommend this book to middle school students who have read the Harry Potter series, and even the Game of Thrones.

Is a story about a hobbit named Frodo Baggins who is sent on a life threatening journey. In this story Gollum and Boromir are corrupted by the power of the ring. Gollum is influenced by the very powerful ring. A ring that is ruler of all rings. Gollum once was a peaceful hobbit, but one day he and his friend were playing by a river and his friend found a golden ring. Gollum wanting the ring for himself, kills his friend and went in the mountains with the ring by his side. Another example of corruption through power is Boroir, When Boromir is introduced in the story he comes off as a very aggressive man wanting power.When Frodo is in the woods Boromir try's to kill him for the ring. The book is more descriptive and makes you feel like you are actually in the story. In the movie there are of total of four chapters missed completely. Another thing in these film is that it makes Boromir come off less creepier then he actually is.The reason I felt that these two characters were influenced by power was because one killed, and the other attended to kill, just to obtain the ring.

It is really a great story, and just corroborates the thought that I\u2019ve always had in mind: that science fiction and fantasy can be so, so, so much deeper than any heartbreaking drama with everyday violence and common people that clenches your soul because it\u2019s so real and so what we are living in. (I\u2019m referring to these based-on-a-true-story tear jerking dramas, that usually have the movies that are based on them, all of them Academy Award winning and highly praised and critically acclaimed and blah blah.) Whereas most science fiction and fantasy stories are just simply not taken seriously or considered nerdy, or whatever. But in fact, there is a severe allegory behind the Ring in this novel, if you think about it. It represents something that is pretty much valid in our real life as well, and you can recognize it if you don\u2019t get stuck on the fact that \u201cOh, what the hell, dwarves and elves don\u2019t even exist!\u201d Anyway, back to the actual novel! So, as I\u2019ve already said, I do think it\u2019s a monumental story. However, and please, don\u2019t stone me people, the narration does have its flaws. I mean, starting a book with 50 pages (50!!!!!) of nothing but idle talk about the pipe-weed in the Shire? Seriously?Fortunately, the exciting story really draws you in after that, so it doesn\u2019t actually scare you away from reading the whole thing, but I do believe it is really slow and dense for someone born in this very recent \u2018age of information\u2019, where you can access anything in a few seconds on the Internet. This is a great insufficiency of the book, because it would mean that it\u2019s not going to be able to keep up with time passing by. And I think this is the main reason why the LOTR movies \u201coutshined\u201d the actual books they were based on, and eventually became more popular than them.

Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring was a very interesting book filled with suspense and well character development. I loved when Frodo slowly began to get more and more courage throughout the book. I also love the part when they are at the Council of Elrond and you get to learn all about what had been happening, and almost all your questions are answered. The theme about the power of corruption is really powerful. It\u2019s like the ring of power represents your one fatal flaw, and in order to overcome it, you need to destroy it at its roots. You may need a mentor or two, and you\u2019ll definitely need your friends by your side the entire time, but once you destroy the one ring, the world will be a better place, even if it\u2019s just for you. Even when Bilbo leaves in the first chapter, it\u2019s a whole theme about self-sacrifice. If he had stayed in the Shire, he would\u2019ve put all the hobbits in danger, especially himself. The whole journey is about overcoming the worst part of yourself. And when you think it\u2019s all over, there may be a twist and you have to do even more, like in Rivendell. You may want to tackle the problem alone, but you will always need someone to help you through your journey. And there will be obstacles, like the Black Riders, where you just want to give up and let into the temptation.

There is a way to embodied legends and history of a world without stuffing one's ear. Sometimes 'less' is better. For such an interesting, crafted setting, Middle-earth, the dialogue is less then stellar.

MUCH more detail about Hobbit history. A bit much really, but I suppose that Mr. JRRT was just having fun.- Seems to me that in \"The Hobbit\" that when Gollum said \"precious\" or \"my precious\" he was referring to himself but in this book it says he's referring to the ring. Huh?Moving along... slowly. Looks like old Tom Bombadil got axed in the movie. Just as well! This part story is so far much less enthralling(too drawn out) than The Hobbit. More detail and less action. Seems like JRRT wanted to get everything in there he could think of, and yes, he's not that good of a writer. A common characteristic of the sci-fi and fantasy genres... Lots of the writing is just functional and the main interest lies in the story and its details. Plus... way too much singing. It's interesting to think about a culture where singing was a common form of ordinary self expression but it seems like rather one-sided, i.e. not conversational.- Sam and Ham live on Bagshot row, a reverse connection to Harry Potter.- The ring story as told by Gandalf has definite religious implications.Still grinding away but a bit discontented with ALL THE WORDS. Much of this was deleted or drastically shortened in the film so the ACTION might commence. As I mentioned above, all the singing/chanting/ reciting is getting on my nerves a bit. But... it is true that a lot of story-telling in olden days was accomplished in this way(see Homer). Plus, JRRT insists on wrapping up every loose end. Onward tonight but not to the end yet. The second and third books are not as long - YEA!- So far I'd have to say that with an average rating of 4.30 this book is at least somewhat overrated.Finished last night with a bit of skim-fast reading. I continue to enjoy the story but at the same time wish that JRRT had sped things up a bit. The description(s) of Lothlorien were beautiful(nice vacation spot!) but as with everything else dragged on a bit. The dialogue and speech-making seem overly stiff at times. Typical for sci-fi and fantasy I guess. Read Jack Vance for a better \"way\". Galadriel's explanation of the fate of the elves vis-a-vis the rings was appropriately and movingly wistful.

Although the constant singing and descriptions of leaves and roots and rocks are not exactly amusing to me as a reader even now. The writing is elegant and I think Tolkien conveys a lot through his dialogues while using very simple speech tags; I think most were \u2018he said\u2019 or \u2018he asked\u2019 without further additions of mood and yet the way the lines were phrased expressed a lot.As for character development, I think Sam is the one that showed most and make no mistake. His speech patterns and comments really gave the reader insight of who he was, what were his expectations and values.  I also think that Boromir was an interesting character and I quite sympathized with his pragmatic point of view. He was honorable yet flawed and, for me, therefore very real.

Sauron had no body, so he stayed as a figure floating on top of his volcano that looked like an orange eye. He owned a ring which was incredibly powerful.

He was about to destroy it when the power of the ring took over him. this power made the person who was holding the ring not want to throw it away and keep it. The ring passed may hands now and then, then finally, a hobbit named Blibo Baggins found the ring and kept it. He found it useful, because once you had the ring around your finger, you became invisible. But you cannot wear it too often or else the power of the ring will become stronger on you. Then one day, Bilbo gave it to his nephew, Frodo Baggins. Frodo Baggins, with his army, heads off to Mordor to destroy the ring.

That is until a mysterious wizard that goes by the name Gandalf comes and pays him a visit. Thereafter, Frodo finds himself going on an adventure to destroy an evil ring that his uncle-turned father left to him in his inheritance. This will take Frodo and his close friends, named Pippin and Sam, through the wonderful but terrifying middle-earth world. Together, with the help of Gandalf and others they meet along the way, the three unlikely adventures are thrown into a cruel world of light and dark. Now, it\u2019s up to Frodo the hobbit to save a whole kingdom, a whole world from being cast into the shadow of darkness. The only question is, will he succeed? Will he even make it back to his peaceful home alive? I loved this book and it kept me entertained and amused throughout. J.R.R. Tolkien does a fantastic job of creating an entirely different world within the pages of the book. The plot turns and twists keep you simply entranced with the novel, and what will happen next.

You don't do it half-assed.But re-reading Fellowship as an adult--and after seeing the films countless of times--there is a feeling of urgency and though you want to feel the \"feels\" sometimes it's just not there (anymore).

How one can create such a world, a history and story of hobbits, elves, dwarves and men is unfathomable. Truly, Tolkien does not get enough credit for his talent.The Fellowship of the Ring, the first book of the Lord of the Rings, is the introduction of Frodo, the nephew of Bilbo (if you have read the Hobbit). He's a rather brave character and one who is courageous enough to set out and complete a task that is dangerous and perhaps deadly. He wasn't my favourite character, I admit, one of my least favourite, in fact. He isn't as merry as Bilbo or amusing. His hobbit friends were much more delightful, Merry, Pippin and most importantly Sam, who remain loyal and protective of Frodo throughout the novel. They are loving, charming and sweet.The other characters are well written, Gandalf the Grey, the witty wizard with many answers, the mortals and very talkative men, Boromir and Aragorn, strong and determined men. The development of the elf Legolas and dwarf Gimili friendship is good, it's a nice relationship to see. The Company's dynamics were well written, as was their interactions.

Picking up some years where the tale of the Hobbit left off the book tells the story of the hobbit Frodo Baggins and his friends (cousin and heir to Bilbo Baggins, the main character of the Hobbit) and tells of their adventure with the ring Bilbo picked up from Gollum long ago. Written as a sequel to the Hobbit the Fellowship of the Ring severely expands on Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle Earth. In the Lord of the Rings we learn a lot more about the history, characters and tales that take place within this legendary world, and this helps bring it to life even more. One can see by reading this tale that Tolkien's writing has matured a lot. Unlike the Hobbit, where the story was very compact and simple, the Lord of the Rings has much more depth to it and is lot more complex. Everything about it (from the plot, Middle-Earth and the characters) has been expanded upon much more. Truly the Lord of the Rings is written as an epic and Tolkien's very writing style (let alone the plot) shows this. The only true fault I could find with this book is what some other people have mentioned and that is that the book is at times a bit slow moving and can seem dull. However, for the most part, Tolkien's vivid description of the scenarios the characters encounter while they are on their journey, (not to mention the characters and their struggles or the impressive bits of action when they do come up) more than make up for these dull moments.

No Doubt J.R.R. is a master of his craft; painting a world with words. I feel that there is just too much detail in the descriptions for me to keep up. Referring to complicated compass bearings when describing landmarks, or where the party is travelling, can make me stop and look at the map constantly to figure out what's happening.However, the characters are unique and complex, and the epic chases and tense stealthy moments are amazing.

The prose throughout the novel is so enjoyable to read. The depiction of the landscape as the fellowship journeys throughout middle-earth is supreme. Along with that the songs and poems that the characters recite are beautiful and musical.The fellowship is made up of a cast of interesting, contrasting and whimsical characters from all different races.The only slightly negative thing (and the reason why I didn\u2019t give it 10/10) is that it does take quite a while to get into the meat of the story. It takes almost 200 pages (nearly half the book) for the actual journey of the fellowship to begin. I think it was because after The Hobbit, I was expecting to be thrown right away into the action. It didn\u2019t massively bother me, but it really picks up the pace around the halfway mark and I really enjoyed it from that point. The events then are exciting and compelling and you get a real sense of the danger of the orcs and other such creatures.

{"text": "\n           \n           Firstly, I would like to settle the debate between Harry potter and lotr by saying this: there simply is no debate. Harry Potter is a children's book that became so well known and widely popular that it is now for all ages and people. Lotr was meant to be an adult fantasy epic series that was also read so pervasively that it became a book for all ages as well. Both series are unequivocally some of the best novels written, but one cannot compare the two because they are completely different and unique.At first I was hesitant to read this book for fear that it would be one of the longest reads that I have ever tried to accomplish. I didn't want to read a very time consuming book because, where I go to school, students are required to read off of a list once they enter the ninth grade. I wanted to cram as many young adult books as I could into my eight grade year before I had to go on to reading only required books which, unfortunately, tend to be most uninteresting.However, I was pleasantly surprised by the pace of the book. Even though I have a crammed schedule and am very busy with extracurricular activities, I managed to finish the first book within a week and a half while finishing 2 other books at the same time. This was a feat that I never though I could have achieved, so if your main concern is how long this book will take you, do not fear!One of the other reasons I was hesitant to read this book was because I was afraid that Tolkien's writing would be incomprehensible and I would retain nothing from the entire novel. However, Tolkien's compilation of wit, a deep understanding of epics, and his innovative characters and ideas create a story that generations and generations to come can enjoy. And please, for the love of god, do NOT just read this book because \"oh, the movie was cool I will try the book I guess\" or because \"oh, I will look smarter if I read this now.\" Tolkien's appreciation for imagination, creativity, and elegance in writing comes shining through in his writing. Do not let his passion get smothered by your want to look smarter or your love of the film adaptation of this book. Take the time to appreciate this wonderful work of literature that Tolkien created.

{"text": "\n           \n           I really love the narrator's voice, Rob Inglis. He does a brilliant job bringing life to these characters and he is pleasant to listen to.I am so happy to be back in this fantastical world. This book is a travel narrative, an epic adventure with friendship, heart, and bravery. It has humor, like \u2018The Hobbit,\u2019 but it definitely has more foreboding, thrill, danger, seriousness, and perilousness to it. The characters value storytelling, and so, in my opinion, this story should be read aloud; it lends itself to listening: the descriptions are poetic and lyrical, beautiful to behold. Honestly, I chose the audiobook version because I had difficulty getting into the books. Even the audiobook was difficult for me to get through, though. The pacing was incredibly slow toward the beginning and middle. Still, I do not regret spending the time to get through it; it was worth the struggle. And read \u2018The Hobbit\u2019 first! This tale is much clearer with the stories told in the prequel. As a side note, my only qualm was Tolkien\u2019s use of the word \u201cqueer;\u201d it must have appeared hundreds of times throughout the narrative. Although, in this context and time period, it meant weird/odd, it no longer means that, and it bothered me to hear it used in such a way.

It has been a while since I have read an epic book like this one with a world so vast and new to me. There were many places in the book where the author dumped large amounts of information (The Council of Elrond being the largest by far) on names of people, places, and legends/stories of events and people long gone. I struggled quite a bit at the beginning to take in all this information and try to form an understanding of this world and its inhabitants but I am doing a little better now. I think this was necessary though to get a grip on the vastness of this world before starting the next books.I enjoyed the adventure of this book with the Company starting the adventure and fighting off many foes and traveling through many interesting and dangerous places. I am starting to get attached to the characters as they are further developed with each new tale they tell and how they react to certain circumstances. This was a mistake on my part, as one of the Company have already (possibly) died. I did not however like the many songs/poems in the book.

{"text": "\n           \n           Upon first sight, one can find the book intimidating. That's alright, many books are more than 531 pages long. But, what \"many books\" don't have, is the detailed, and intricately crafted world that  series boasts. One need not fully realise the world initially, but doing so greatly increases the enjoyability of the novel, and one can forgive the endless barrage of sleep-inducing songs and poems.The plot, just like in  is a standard Hero's Journey template. In fact, it can be described in a few words. Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, vanishes from his hometown, the Shire, on his one-hundred-and-eleventh (or eleventy-oneth for more ardent fans) birthday, after a huge party. His nephew of sorts, Frodo Baggins, inherits all his property including the hole in which they lived (hobbits live in holes. Don't you know that yet?) and a perfectly circular, gold invisibility ring. Now, although I describe it as an invisibility ring, it has great, hidden powers of evil, with whose help it continually tries to get back to its maker, the Dark Lord, Sauron, who resides in Mordor. It is up to Frodo to take the ring to safety, and make sure that it is destroyed. This can be done only by casting it into the fires of Mount Doom (really Tolkien? You thought up such imaginative names for everything else, and all you could come up with for Orodruin was \"the Cracks of Doom\"?). Despite the unintentional laughter which this may incite, it is treated surprisingly seriously.His journey is divided into two parts in . One is to Rivendell, home of elves, and the other one from there to the breaking of the titular fellowship. Two things surprised me most, one was that the most iconic line in the films, \"One does not simply walk into Mordor,\" is entirely absent, and the other was the abrupt ending. Half-a-star gone there.The plot moves along briskly, with beautifully prosed descriptions that titillate the reader's imagination, and fairly interesting and likable, albeit unidimensional, characters. Indeed, I would have even forgiven the occasionally god-awful dialogue too, seeing all the pros of the storyline, had it not been for the songs. The Songs, I should call them, the Dreadful Songs. Characters randomly burst out into musical melodies which would make even Shah Rukh Khan cower, beholding their amazing plot-stopping properties which surpasses even those of his.Gollum (my favourite character) has a mere cameo appearance, though I hope that Tolkien has done something about that in the other two books.Oh, and a note: Gandalf, the wizard's death scene was short, and lacked the power it should have had. The mourning that followed ventured not into the minds of the Fellowship, but stayed outside, describing the beauty of the Lothlorien woods. This I disapproved. Characters are simpler than in , something which I didn't find much of a problem, but definitely counts as a step backwards, however, I did take issue with the stereotypical differentiation between good and evil. Black = evil. Good = white. I like more of the grey stuff, if you take my meaning, although this is just a personal preference.The greatness that this book often achieves undoubtedly overshadows most of the qualms that one can have about the book, and makes the shortcomings seem forgiveable, but the abrupt ending was a cause of why this book isn't \"amazing\" And the songs.

I read it a couple of years ago and back then, I only gave it 4 stars. What was I thinking? For some bizarre reason, I did not appreciate the epicness of J.R.R Tolkien\u2019s classic masterpiece. Thanks to a rewatch of the movies with my friends, I became obsessed with the world that Tolkien created so I decided to give the books another chance. This time, everything about this book blew my mind. The Fellowship of the Ring was the beginning of an amazing but perilous journey. The first few chapters were quite slow because it had to set up the characters as well as the history which lead to the One Ring being in Frodo\u2019s possession. Some of the reviews that I read said that they were turned off by the long and detailed description of nature but for me, I quite enjoyed it. It made it easier for me to imagine the world that the characters were in. From the movies, I loved every character in the Fellowship and by reading the book, I love them even more especially Sam.

{"text": "\n           \n           My favourite of the three parts of the LOTR, the Fellowship is just as good at the Hobbit! There is a slight distinction in the writing style, as The hobbit is intended for children and the LOTR, for adults but the stories flow nicely. It's hard to describe this book as a whole because there are so many events that occur, so I will limit myself to a few comments:I think my favourite part about this book (and the entire LOTR) is the relationships between characters, particularly between Gimli and Legolas. I laughed, enjoyed their playful competition and banter, and their overall dynamic. The character development is wonderfully done.Another area of success is Tolkien's description of the environment- places, weather, sleeping conditions, etc. It makes you feel like these species and events could actually exist and help to produce a vivid image in your mind. He describes things to death but does it well..There really isn't anything to criticize...it's just a great work.

{"text": "\n           \n           This is the start of possibly the greatest fantasy novel ever written, The Fellowship Of The Ring. I started reading this as soon as I was done with The Hobbit. I was always interested in The Lord Of The Rings, since every nerd wouldn't shut up about it, and it didn't help that the Peter Jackson movies made its popularity sky rocket. Honestly though, after I watched all the movies (which is draining by the way), I wanted to know what the books are like, and what did the movies do to make it work for cinema, and make more pleasing to a more casual audience. So here I am writing a review and the first part of the massive novel The Lord Of The Rings, titled The Fellowship Of The Ring. The story starts of in a familiar town known as Hobbiton. Here we meet our starting main characters such as Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Merry Took, Pippin Brandywine, and Gandalf. Frodo soons has to bear the burden of carrying the One Ring to rule them all to the evil place known as Mordor, and caste the Ring into the fire of MT. Doom. With him however, to help bear this burden, is Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragon son of Arathorn, Gimli the dwarf son of Gloin, Legolas the elf from Mirkwood forest, and Boromir son of the lord of Gondor, forming the Fellowship Of The Ring. Along the way the characters must go through dangerous obstacles, one of which is the Mines Of Moria in the Misty Mountains. Its here that we see how strong Gandalf the wizard can actually be, being able to take down the demon from the ancient world, the Balrog \"You cannot pass\". Frodo goes through the most in this story, being that hes a vulnerable young hobbit, has to carry the One Ring, and is also being tracked by the Dark Lord himself Sauron. The theme in this story I believe is companionship, friendship, and strength of heart. Frodo has to be strong with the Ring, and the fellowship must stay together and work together to get through the challenges ahead. In conclusion, I think this is a fantastic start to a fantastic novel. It has just about everything that makes fantasy amazing. Rich, memorable, and relatable characters, detailed settings and landmarks, scenes that will suck you into the story, this is a tale that I think everyone should give a shot whether you like fantasy, or not. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Drew M", "stars": "5", "date": "Oct 03, 14", "likes": "0"},

I just had a baby and I've been reading stuff that is familiar to me so that when I'm exhausted and still up with the baby at 3 am, my reading won't task my faculties too much. That said, despite my exhaustion I'm still engrossed by the book and am continually moved by Tolkein's subtle and not-so-subtle observations about human nature as well as his fantastic-mythological-elements that feel so deeply embedded into the world he describes that they are as familiar as human nature. I've been collecting quotes from the book, and sometimes I have a hard time not \"quoting\" entire chapters.Of the three books in the trilogy, FotR is the most concerned with the past and the magic of Middle Earth , specifically the elves, while the other two are concerned with men, the future. It is an interesting structural choice, and the effect is to create a mood of a specific kind of beauty, mystery, and the pathos of loss and diminishment in FotR. Conversely the Shire is a beautiful, pristine if provincial place with a distinct and merry appeal of its own. The hobbits, unconcerned with dominion, occupy an interesting marginal space that opens up their unique kind of magic that becomes the key to the salvation of middle earth. And between our introduction to hobbits and elves we become acutely aware of that which is worth protecting in middle earth, raising the stakes for the quest with each stop on the journey. The greatest appeal in this first book is the exploration of these rich and beautiful cultures, fictional cultures that ring true, perhaps because of the density of their histories, but also because of the diversity of their peoples. Even hobbits, who seem so homogenous to outsiders, we quickly see can be highly individualized. As I sit awake having a late night of baby fussiness yet again, I'm finding my silver lining in the knowledge that I'm only 1/3 of the way through the LotR trilogy.

The Fellowship of the Ring is a wonderful story about a hobbit named Frodo who, through no fault of his own, must take on the responsibility of destroying an evil ring. To do so he must travel across middle earth to the land of Mordor and cast the ring into the fiery mountain in which it was made. However, Frodo is not alone in his efforts. He is accompanied by a Fellowship (hence the name) of nine members from many different races who strive to help him to carry the ring.. In the book, before Frodo is picked to bear the ring, there is a council in which they are to decide what to do. The council is at a point where everyone has been arguing over what is to be done with the ring and I think this passage really gets at one of the themes in the book which is one\u2019s duty and responsibility towards others. When Frodo volunteers to take the ring he is thinking not of himself but of the rest of Middle Earth. We read: Frodo doesn't do what he thinks is easy instead he does what is his Duty to the rest of middle earth and takes the ring. In my opinion Frodo is an inspiring character and this makes the book great. The Fellowship of the Ring is a book about friendship, responsibility, bravery, and duty in the face of hardship.

There is so much emphasis on poetry and the small beauties of his surroundings... of course the maps (beautiful) anchor him into the epic adventure thing, but I never felt that Frodo was seeing it like that. His world is smaller. More modest. Which both makes his journey more beautiful and scarier, I think. Anyway I really enjoyed the book (despite constantly comparing to the movie), and was not expecting as many beautiful little moments as there were - in particular, the small paragraph when Frodo speaks up at Elrond's council.

And throughout, given my ADD, I have trouble with the great detail with which Tolkien tells the tale. All the intricate history that Tolkien conjures up is too much for me to process and I find myself just wanting to know what happens next and not every little fact about geography and lore. I don't mean to sound unappreciative of his creative intellect, but it's just not something I have enough mental RAM to handle (it feels much like I'm going to be quizzed on this stuff later, rather than as a cheery side-note to the main plot). The only other complaint, if you could call it that, that I would make is that the climax points are far too brief. We get page after page devoted to describing our main characters walking through various lands and setting up camp, and staying watch, and waking up and setting off again, etc. But when the action finally starts to get good, we usually get only a few pages before things settle down again. All that being said, when the book is good I enjoy it thoroughly. I must say, that I may not have enjoyed this book without first having watched the movies. There are many names and places to remember and keep in mind, and having seen the movies helps me to envision these better. It was interesting, though, to read the book, having first seen the movie(s). And as I read the book, I would pause and watch the movie up until that point in the book. This experience has given me less respect for the movies, though, at least insofar as Peter Jackson (or whoever has most to do with the adaptation) made changes that seemed unnecessary (e.g. who said what -- which in some cases is crucial to a particular characters' development). In fact, the movie was so much different from the book so frequently that it bothered me greatly and I found myself sighing and getting uncomfortable when certain parts in the movie were drawn out way longer than in the books, or when minute details were sufficiently different (or simply omitted) to the point of distorting the flow and feel of the story. This is the very same feeling I got while watching the first part of the new Hobbit film, and why I vowed not to watch the other two installments. But that's a different can of worms. It may be that my being upset with Jackson for changing things having to do with the Hobbit was based on ignorance, because this now seems to be nothing new for him in his involvement with these books (at least if the differences between the books and movies holds for the other two volumes). In any case, I'm hoping that, like the latter two films, the next two books are better than the first.

{"text": "\n           \n           Author JRR Tolkien excellently wrote the novel, The Fellowship of the Ring. Taking place in an old-time fantasy world, Middle Earth, a young hobbit, a short man with an easygoing temperament and a love of all living things, embarks on an adventure with his magical wizard friend, Gandalf. They must destroy an all powerful and extremely evil ring that can control any creature in Middle Earth. \tWith grand language and extraordinary detail, Tolkien tells the story in a way that I have never seen done by any other author. Tolkien uses just about every literary device in an effort to tell this fantasy tale. One of my favorite things about this novel is the excellent imagery used throughout the story. \u201cFrodo stood awhile still lost in wonder. It seemed to him that he had stepped through a high window that looked on a vanished world. A light was upon it for which his language had no name. All that he saw was shapely, but the shapes seemed at once clear cut, as if they had been first conceived and drawn at the uncovering of his eyes, and ancient as if they had endured for ever. He saw no colour but those he knew, gold and white and blue and green, but they were fresh and poignant, as if he had at that moment first perceived them and made for them names new and wonderful. In winter here no heart could mourn for summer or for spring. No blemish or sickness or deformity could be seen in anything that grew upon the earth. On the land of Lorien there was no stain.\u201d (Tolkien 365). This quote stuck out to me because it is plain to see that Tolkien is very passionate about nature, and does a magnificent job of expressing such statement. Not only that, but also this quote really paints a mental picture of the scene, ripping the reader from his seat, and spitting him out alongside Frodo in \u201cthe land of Lorien\u201d.\tOverall, I would highly recommend this novel to anyone seeking out a fantastical tale unlike anything else out there.

New inventions on the spur of the moment just reduce the credibility of the story.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Krishna Kumar", "stars": "4", "date": "May 18, 15", "likes": "0"},

I have always liked reading books of the fantasy genre and as this book was written in the 1960s, it is one of the first books of its genre to include elves, an \"ancient language\", and dwarves, hobbits, wizards, orcs, trolls and all other sorts of mythical creatures. It seems many of the fantasy books I have read that were written more recently such as Eragon have been based heavily on Tolkein's ideas. I almost feel that Christopher Paulini simply stole major aspects of the lord of the rings and added some dragons and made a bunch of money. Anyway, I love all the poems and songs that Tolkein includes in his work. I feel like they add a lot of creativity to the story and I haven't really seen that done in a book before. There is really not too much violence in the book. I thought there would be more but there isn't much so far. There is a little humor which is nice because a lot of the book explains the travels of the hobbits and can get very serious and a little bit boring. There are so many characters and places that have little meaning so if you don't remember them, it's ok. The main characters are easy to remember and they all play a distinct role in the plot, though Frodo is the most important because he is the ring-bearer. Tolkein takes a great deal of time to describe the setting and it is really easy to immerse yourself in the lands that the characters travel through. He also is good at creating suspense and fear as he builds up the action with the Black Riders until finally the climactic battle happens.

It cannot be the writing. Tolkien crafts wooden one dimensional characters: Frodo the \"brave\" hobbit, Sam the \"loyal\" hobbit, Gandalf the \"good\" wizard, etc. Much of the book is spent in lengthy descriptions of the landscape: the trees (elms, larches, oaks, etc.), the hills, the misty mountains, the valleys, the rivers, the lakes, the ponds, and so many flowers to make a botanist envious; but little actually happens in the work. There is little to no character development. It is as if Tolkien got caught up in his own grandeur: he was writing an Epic and so it had to read like one.

{"text": "\n           \n           The Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring, written by J.R.R. Tolkien and published by Harper Collins, is a third-person, fantasy novel primarily told from the point-of-view of Frodo Baggins, heir to the Baggins family wealth and otherwise good, young chap. The Bagginses are Hobbits, creatures like men but much shorter and with hairy feet from the realm of Middle-Earth that keep to themselves in their own little shire, The Shire, until one day, a ring bestowed upon Frodo by his uncle, Bilbo, is revealed to be a tool for an evil sorcerer, Sauron. Though Sauron died, in theory, Frodo\u2019s friend and confidant, Gandalf, a powerful wizard who once helped Bilbo on his own journey, encourages Frodo to go to Rivendell, a High Eleven outpost, with the ring, to determine the fate of all of Middle-Earth. The ring itself holds many strange powers, though for Frodo, it makes him invisible, but otherwise, it can unlock the physical manifestation of Sauron again and end the world. Encouraged not to use the ring, Frodo depends on those he meets on the way, like his other friends who join him, Sam, Merry, and Pippin, and of course, Gandalf, in addition to a slew of other strange people from mythical backgrounds: Strider, the mysterious ranger; Gimli, the dwarven son of one of Bilbo\u2019s companions; Legolas, a wood elf with remarkable talents; and Boromir, a great human warrior from Minas Tirith. These nine together must overcome Sauron\u2019s minions: powerful black riders serving directly under the dark lord, monstrous orcs hungry for blood, and one ancient demon of fire known only as a balrog. The goal is to cast the ring into the pits of fire from where it was forged, so Frodo and his companions set out as the fellowship of the ring.This is my second Tolkien book\u2014the first was The Hobbit, Bilbo\u2019s adventure into ancient realms to steal the treasure of Smaug, this asshole dragon. Of course, like The Lord of the Rings, it\u2019s being made into a major motion picture in three parts\u2014which makes a lot more sense for The Lord of the Rings than it does The Hobbit, but we\u2019ll talk about why Peter Jackson is a douche later. In the meantime, The Lord of the Rings has played a very profound role in my life, even for a guy who never read it. My brothers are big role-players, and I don\u2019t mean in the bedroom, though who knows. Maybe. Probably. Either way, having spent the majority of their lives organizing Dungeons & Dragons campaigns, The Lord of the Rings in my splintered household was very much like The Bible in an ordinary, Christian family. It was important for me, in my teenage years without a mother around and living with my brothers alone, to know the difference between an elf and a dwarf, the value of mythril, and just what spells work best against the undead. My older brother, Thomas, owned an arsenal of medieval weaponry, including maces, swords, daggers, flails, and any number of additional weaponry that he hung proudly off the walls of our suburban home. Our library consisted of cheap fantasy novels, role playing compendiums, and franchise books that bordered on fan fiction. It\u2019s no surprise that I too rarely write fantasy, a rebellion against my very upbringing, but you can\u2019t abandon your roots forever.But I\u2019ve grown older and come to see the value of it. After combing through The Hobbit in anticipation of those films, I discovered how fantastic the journeys in fantasy stories really are, scouring the realms for treasure and some ethical ideal of heroism. My immersion in games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and television shows like Game of Thrones were particularly powerful reminders of the intentions made in my upbringing, so when I saw a trailer for a video game called The Shadows of Mordor, I thought I\u2019d give it a shot. You can read the linked post, but it\u2019s essentially Assassin\u2019s Creed set in The Lord of the Rings. Pretend like that\u2019s not fucking awesome. In any case, I\u2019ve decided to throw myself back into Middle-Earth again as a result.The Fellowship of the Ring is weak in a lot of places when taken into the context of the recently made film adaptations. As I read these books, I had to remove myself from my expectations of the book based on the film in order to fully understand what the author was doing. That\u2019s not to say that the film is so good, it overshadows the books\u2014quite the contrary, in fact. As I read this novel, I kept finding myself awaiting moments from the film, anticipating things to happen as they did in the films. Halfway through the novel, I began to acknowledge that habit and realized that the film bastardized large portions of the novel, considering how long I waited to see what came next. That\u2019s not to say that the films are bad, but the novel shows a lot more skill.The thing you have to remember is that in spite of the existence of Sauron, the selfishness of Saruman, and the feverish attacks of the orcs, none of these play a central antagonist in the book. Rather, it\u2019s the ring itself that plays the main villain. Very rarely do you read of an author who uses an object to create both fear and antagonism to move the plot along, a simple item that the characters carry with them which also acts as a plot device because of it\u2019s unusual behaviors. After all, it\u2019s not Sauron that inevitably breaks up the fellowship (God, I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for you at this point), but the ring itself and how it comes between Frodo and the rest of his party. The dangers that lurk around every corner don\u2019t threaten the fellowship half as much as their own yearning for the ring, as it slowly disseminates our heroes without their knowing. Using an item alone that serves no single purpose to forge a conflict that extends through three novels is feat I can\u2019t imagine will ever again be done quite so well. At the moment, I\u2019d be hard pressed to write a short story with the same kind of conflict, let alone a single goddamn novel about it. However, it\u2019s this same vilification of an object that makes The Lord of the Rings so epic.The Fellowship of the Ring isn\u2019t about the ring so much though, as it is about building the relationship between the characters of Aragorn and Frodo. When they kick things off, Aragorn is a stern, paranoid ranger that poses as much danger as he does friendship, but over the course of the novel, Frodo begins to trust Aragorn. Tolkien accomplishes this by, essentially, killing off or creating distance between Frodo and those he naturally trusts in the story and forcing Aragorn into their position. As trouble manifests as a result of Frodo\u2019s evil ring, Frodo\u2019s dependence on Aragorn grows through the dissolution of Frodo\u2019s own child-like naivete, represented by the other hobbits in his party. At the same time, Aragorn\u2019s own natural leadership is juxtaposed against the feelings and beliefs of the other surviving party members, especially Boromir who shows nothing but contempt for Frodo being chosen to carry the ring to Mordor. By using other characters to both represent and uniquely define the central characters of this novel, Tolkien encourages communication and relationship evolution between his central characters that ultimately creates a dynamic of genuine friendship, comparable to a romantic kinship in spite of the obvious opposites between the two characters.The highlight of this novel is its description. It\u2019s no surprise that Tolkien considered himself a poet, because the word choice in every description is downright phenomenal. Everything is colored and portrayed with words to the extent that you can\u2019t help but see the images as beautifully as they appeared in the film. Though his dialogue is a bit stunted, the careful, yet powerful, descriptions, enhanced by their eloquence, make up for whatever we miss as we progress through the novel. Every step of the journey is tracked and every lineage is marked, but it never bored me. I was engaged in spite of how mundane some of these ideas were, because of how skillful Tolkien wrote, avoiding cliches in a day rife with them while building on even the most regular of sights with descriptions enough to make them sound as though they\u2019re the most beautiful, or in some cases most horrible, things that I\u2019ve never before seen. It\u2019s more than likely that most audiences have seen the films, but haven\u2019t read the books. I\u2019m not going to tell you what you\u2019re missing\u2014that wouldn\u2019t be any fun, but I will say that Jackson chops out whole sections of the book, shortening things to the point where months in the story feel like mere days. I can understand a bit of heavy cutting in some cases, but what remains isn\u2019t true the novel either. Dialogue is added, most notably humor, as well as events that were never written, meant to emotionally charge the audience. When I think of a film adapted from a book, it\u2019s okay to permit that kind of stuff with what have generally been accepted as lousy books. Who\u2019s to say a book is lousy? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll leave that to the general masses who made the film, Drive, into a masterpiece but left the book hinged on, \u201cEh\u2026\u201d What I like about what Jackson does is that he creates moments of humor that didn\u2019t previously exist in the book to lighten the subject matter. However, he also falls off on various thoughts that Tolkien, I can only imagine, preferred to keep. When Boromir comes striding into Rivendell on a horse, I only thought, \u201cWhy would you include that?\u201d After all, in the story, Boromir fucking walked to Rivendell to meet with the council, having lost his horse along the way. That may not be important to you, Mr. Jackson, but that\u2019s important to me, in spite of your efforts to find a villain while overlooking the obvious. My negative feelings on the subject matter of Jackson\u2019s films go beyond just disapproval in the details, considering how he\u2019s stretching The Hobbit, a novel shorter than Fellowship of the Ring, into three separate parts, but a guy has to make money, right? Even if he is a Jabba-the-Hut, Lucas-esque piece of shit. In spite of all that, Jackson makes pretty movies and if I owned his trilogy on Blu-Ray, I may have kinder feelings for him. Too bad that I don\u2019t. As far as my opinion goes, Jackson can eat shit for all the money he\u2019s trying to make off Tolkien.If you even liked the movie remotely, read the book and enjoy it for what it\u2019s supposed to be. It certainly feels like the beginning of a trilogy, but in-and-of-itself, it\u2019s an epic tale of friendship, discovery, and finding not all good and evil come in tremendous extremes but in the most unexpected of places.The following review has been copied from \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Behnam Riahi", "stars": "5", "date": "Mar 17, 14", "likes": "0"},

{"text": "\n           \n           \tThe Fellowship of The Ring by J.R.R Tolkien is the first book out of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is the beginning of the story of the ring bearer Frodo Baggins. In the beginning Bilbo wills Bag End to his nephew Frodo and leaves the Shire, the home of the Hobbits. Upon Bilbo\u2019s departure Frodo moves into Bag End. Gandalf then appears seventeen years later and ushers Frodo onto his epic journey after suspecting Frodo has possession of Sauron\u2019s ring. As Frodo travels with his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin from the Shire, to Bree they encounter a dangerous foe. The hobbits come to meet a ranger known as Strider who then reveals him to be Aragorn son of Arathorn. Aragorn then confirms his identity by quoting a line from a letter from Gandalf to Frodo. \u201cAll that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost\u201d (Tolkien, 233). On their trip Frodo is struck with a Morgul Blade by Ring Wraiths, the bearers of the other rings of Sauron that are connected to the ring in Frodo\u2019s possession through Sauron. The company then makes it to Rivendell the home of the elves where Frodo is healed by Elrond, king of the elves. After Frodo is healed there is a council that is held to determine the fate of the ring that Frodo has brought. At the council the final members of the Fellowship are decided. The members are Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, Boromir, Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, and Frodo whom volunteers to take on the burden of the ring. They then embark on their new mission to destroy the ring in Mordor and travel to the Mines of Moria where Gandalf is seemingly lost in the battle against the Balrog, a monster. The remaining members make haste to Lorien where they take refuge for some time. They then take off again down a river where they are attacked by orcs and Frodo and Sam leave the fellowship to complete the journey to destroy the ring of power. I enjoyed The Fellowship of The Ring immensely. I liked that the story really pulls one into the world of Middle Earth and paints more than a picture but a reality with only using words. Tolkien has created his own world in this book; he has forged his own race of beings and their history and language. \u201cReading gives us someplace to go when we have to stay where we are\u201d \u2013Mason Cooley. The book made itself seem like more than just a fantasy world but its own reality. For this I appreciated greatly because I want to be able to read a story that opens up a new world to me that can be accessed through wherever I am and whenever. My essential question for The Fellowship of the Ring is \u201cHow does corruption manifest itself?\u201d The Ring of Power is a source for all corruption. Corruption is manifested in the hearts of many throughout the book. The Ring easily sways Boromir and calls to him and causes him to turn on Frodo. Boromir then insists that the Ring comes to his possession for he will use it to defeat Sauron and bring power to Minas Tirith. \u201cThe Ring would give me a power of Command. How I would drive the hosts of Mordor, and all men would flock to my banner!\u201d (Tolkien, 515) Being in possession of the Ring brings corruption to all who come near it. It has turned Smeagol a Hobbit, into the creature now known as Gollum over time. It is like a drug and makes all addicted to the power and bring out the worst in all. This can be seen through Bilbo having it in his possession for many years. Bilbo finds it hard to part with the Ring and when he does he quickly flocks back to it. \u201cTo his distress and amazement he found that he was no longer looking at Bilbo; a shadow seemed to have fallen between them, and through it he found himself eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands.\u201d (Tolkien, 306) Throughout the book Frodo slowly becomes attached to the ring as well. My favorite quote from The Fellowship of The Ring is \u201cfaithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens\u201d (Tolkien, 367). This is my favorite quote because I myself can relate to the quote well. I believe that the quote means that those that are faithless are the ones who give up when the going becomes tough. Which means to give up when it gets hard is weak. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Mia", "stars": "5", "date": "Feb 26, 15", "likes": "0"},

{"text": "\n           \n           The book I read this month was the classic J.R.R Tolkien\u2019s The Fellowship of the Ring, which is the first novel to the trilogy. The edition of the book was published in Great Britain by HarperCollinsPublishers 1994. This type of book was a an excellent fantasy. The main theme in this book is darkness and evil growing. J.R.R. Tolkien has also written the great old classic The Hobbit which is a prelude to The Lord of The Rings. The story is about a boy named Frodo who is a hobbit and he lives in the Shire which is a region were all hobbits live. Frodo is given a ring ring of dark power from his great wizard friend Gandalf who says \u201cTake it for safe keeping,\u201d(Tolkien 36). Dark evil people called dark riders go to his house to find the ring, but they do not find it. Gandalf says he must leave and Frodo goes with his great friend Sam Gamgee. Bilbo then goes on a great quest with other people that volunteered to go with him at the council in Rivendell which is the great elvish- city. Their mission is to destroy the ring and destroy evil for good. On their way they go through difficult situations.The Lord of The Rings is an entertaining book, because their exictment on every page. They are fighting evil, finding new discoveries about the world in front of them and they make new friends on their quest. This book affected me by taking me to timeless land where I could be the hero I want to be. I used to think anyone could be a hero, but now I realize it could be anyone. If Frodo is a hero and he\u2019s just a scrawny guy then I could be a hero. In my life I have always strived to being a hero in some particular way. In the end, this book was very exciting and their issues are resolved by heroism, honor, and teamwork. In my opinion if you are going to read this book, I would recommend that you have a long time in the day to read this, because you won\u2019t be able to put it down. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Declan", "stars": "5", "date": "Oct 04, 14", "likes": "0"},

I was a teenager last time I read Fellowship, and much has intervened: other fantasy novels, LOTR games and merchandise, and of course the Peter Jackson movie series that has colonised all our imaginations and ensured that Frodo will always look like wide-eyed Elijah Wood to me. But getting back to the original, especially now I know quite a bit about English literature and especially Anglo-Saxon literature and language, has been an unexpected delight. Unexpected, because my teenage impatience with Tom Bombadil and the terribly long time it takes for anything it happen coloured my memory of this book. In fact, council of Elrond aside, the book has a cracking pace. A real highlight was Moria, where Tolkers used the sense of sound over and over again to build atmosphere and tension. But the real glory of this book and of Tolkien's writing is the deep sense of mythic Englishness with which he infuses every line. More than any other novel I have read, this book opens up vistas that feel both wonderfully strange and yet profoundly familiar. The writing speaks to me on a cellular level, and that might seem like too-high praise but there really is no praise high enough for this singular, genius of a writer; for this wonderful, wonderful story. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Kim Wilkins", "stars": "5", "date": "Jan 01, 14", "likes": "0"},

The setting takes place in the fictional land known as Middle Earth where all kinds of mythical creatures roam the lands.

In order for him to regain this power and take Middle Earth, he must find the all so powerful ring no matter the costs.

A basic overview of the novel is: how Frodo inherits the ring, Sauron's growing power throughout middle-earth, the hobbit's journey to Rivendell while being followed by Sauron's Black Riders, how the fellowship of the ring is formed, and how they are able to help the one ring-bearer complete the quest.

{"text": "\n           \n           Bilbo Baggins had a huge birthday party with huge amounts of food for everyone that came. Gandalf the wizard showed up too. After the party, Bilbo left the Shire because he wanted to live alone and finish his book. When he left, he left Frodo with the magical ring that would turn you invisible and stop you from aging. But, the ring was evil and dangerous to use. Luckily, Gandalf told him not to put it on. Frodo had to go to Rivendell with his friends, Pippin, Sam, and Merry. He had to go because it was very important that he got the ring there before he got caught by the evil Sauron\u2019s slaves, called the Ring Wraiths, and they returned Sauron\u2019s ring of power to him. Frodo and his friends stay the night at an inn. While at the inn, they meet a man, named Aragorn. Aragorn accompanies them on their quest. The Ring Wraiths catch up to them and Frodo runs to the House of Elrond in Rivendell. They have to cross a ford to get to it. Frodo goes to the House of Elrond because Elrond has a special power to control water that is in the ford. When Frodo was crossing the ford, he had a hard time. He made it to the House of Elrond, but passed out. Luckily, Elrond saw the Ring Wraiths coming. Elrond made a flood that washed away all of the Ring Wraiths temporarily. The flood had just caused the Ring Wraiths horses to die. The Ring Wraiths are already dead, so they can not die.Frodo wakes up in The House of Elrond several days later. Gandalf is sitting next to him. Frodo was very excited to see Gandalf because he had not seen him for a long time. He was glad to know that Aragorn and his friends were all safe too. While in the House of Elrond they have a big meeting to discuss the ring and who will be the ring bearer to take it to Mount Doom. Mount Doom is the place that they must go to destroy the ring so that Sauron will never have the chance to take over Middle Earth. After discussing for a while, everyone decides that Frodo is a good choice to be the bearer of the ring. He already possesses the ring anyways. They also decide that Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, and Boromir will be the companions that go with Frodo to Mount Doom. Gandalf leads his fellow companions, including Frodo, to Mount Doom. Gandalf takes them through the Mines of Moria so that Sauron\u2019s evil spies do not know where they are. They do, however, get attacked by an army of orcs. They then come to a room where Balin the Dwarf is buried. Giants break into the room and they then have to take the back exit. Gandalf falls down into a big hole with a giant. The rest of them barely escape. Further along their journey, they meet the elves that live in Lothlorien who live in the trees. They helped the company with a lot of their needs and gave them more supplies. After meeting and talking at Lothlorien, they decide to ride the river by boat. They knew that it would be faster than walking and would save their energy for when they really needed it. Along the way down the river, Sam, thought he saw a log floating in the water with eyes that was following them. He was worried. Later that night, Frodo saw Gollum as well. Gollum was an evil creature that Bilbo had stolen the ring from and he wanted it back. Gollum had been following them ever since they were in the Mines of Moria. A journey to Mount Doom can never be safe for even a moment. They know this is true, but it always comes by surprise. Later on, after breakfast, as they were floating down the river, there were some Orcs on the other side who were trying to shoot them. They barely escaped. When they were calm and had time to think, they remembered that those were the same Orcs from Moria. They had come to avenge their captain that Frodo had killed from their previous encounter. Frodo began to get tired, so he had an important decision to make. He could go straight to Mordor or take a break for a while. Bormir had a sudden freak out. He attacked Frodo to get the ring from him. This is because the ring makes people want it for power for their own kingdom. Frodo frantically put the ring on and ran away while invisible. Frodo had been gone for a really long time, so all of his mates started to look for him. Sam figured out that he was going to try to leave all by himself so that nobody would be injured. Sam went to the shore to see if a boat was on the water that might be Frodo. Sure enough, there was a boat that looked like it was moving by itself. Sam knew that it was Frodo with the ring on. So, instead of telling everybody where Frodo was and what he was doing. Sam just went with Frodo to finish his journey. They managed to leave without anybody even seeing them. \t The intended audience for this book would probably have to be young adults and adults.Setting: All of this occurs in the place that the characters in the book call middle earth. That is the general setting. They also go to the Mines of Moria, House of Elrond, Rivendell, and many other places. The setting contributes to the story by relating to things in the past of the characters and they all make the journey exciting. Main Characters: Frodo is the main protagonist character. He is a hobbit who has big feet. Because, all hobbits have big feet. He was given the gold ring to destroy it for Bilbo Baggins who decided that he wanted to be alone. Frodo holds the ring until him, his friends, and Gandolf the Wizard have a meeting and decide who will take the ring and destroy it. They end up choosing Frodo anyways. This is a good choice because the ring makes people evil and is a bad ring. Hobbits, however are less affected by the ring's power. So, he doesn't turn into an evil person. The main antagonist is the 9 Ring Wraiths. These guys were sent by the evil Sauron to steal the gold ring so that Sauron can have it and use it for power. This is bad because...Sauron is bad. The Ring Wraiths don't have bodies and they always ride on horses. They wear black cloaks and are evil. I like this book because it was a very good adventure that I thought was fun, but it was boring in a sense because it had much unneeded content. Some of it was just stuff that could have been skipped, but I guess that it was just trying to be as detailed as possible. Two quotes from the book is \"I wish it not have happened in my time\" -Frodo \"So do I\" Said Gandalf \"And so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.\" I like these quotes because they are relatable. The theme I chose for this book is \"A given prophesy is not always a good one. I chose it because the book is basically about a prophesy, with the ring and everything. And, their is trouble. So, unlike the Disney movies, this has a bad and scary story. This book is unique in someway because the author really pays attention to detail and it is descriptive. It goes on about things that other books would not. I rated this book 4.5 out of 5 stars because the book was really fun with a long adventurous journey, but there were some boring parts.

{"text": "\n           \n           The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the RingBook Review The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a fantasy/fiction novel written by J.R.R Tolkien. It is the first of three volumes in The Lord of the Rings, an epic set in the fictional world of Middle-earth. The main underlying theme in the book is Good vs. Evil. J.R.R Tolkien has written other books including, The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Sauron is the main villain throughout the series and he is searching for the One Ring to conquer Middle-earth. The story of The Lord of the Rings begins with several events that take place in The Hobbit. While wandering lost in a deep cave, Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit\u2014one of a small, kindly race about half the size of Men\u2014stumbles upon a ring and takes it back with him to the Shire, the part of Middle-earth that is the Hobbits\u2019 home. All Bilbo knows of his ring is that wearing it causes him to become invisible. He is unaware that it is the One Ring, and is therefore oblivious to its significance and to the fact that Sauron has been searching for it.Bilbo gives his ring, on his 111th birthday, to his cousin Frodo Baggins. When the time comes to part with the ring, however, Bilbo becomes strangely reluctant to do so. He gives up the ring only at the determined urging of his friend, Gandalf the Grey, a great Wizard. Gandalf suspects that the ring is indeed the One Ring of legend. After confirming his suspicions, he tells Frodo that the Ring must be taken away from the Shire, as Sauron\u2019s power is growing once again.Frodo sets out from the Shire with three of his Hobbit friends\u2014Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Along the way, many evil and foul creatures pursue them. They met many assets along the way, who happen to be Gandalf\u2019s friends. Frodo\u2019s hobbit friends and Gandalf\u2019s friends form a fellowship to protect Frodo on his perilous journey. The book is very entertaining and Tolkien creates a painting inside of your heads by creatively using figurative language. It is also a suspense builder leading up to the action-packed moments. The possibilities that the book suggests might be that something can either be pure evil or pure good.Overall, The Fellowship of the Ring is a great book filled with plot twisters and plenty of action. I highly advise you to read The Hobbit first before reading The Lord of the Rings series.\n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Aneesh Balla", "stars": "5", "date": "Oct 03, 14", "likes": "0"},

{"text": "\n           \n            In The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien, Frodo Baggins finds himself in ownership of a ring that can potentially destroy the world if it is used for evil. Frodo and his gang of hobbits have to take the ring and throw it into the mountain of Mordor, which is the only place it can be destroyed. Meanwhile they are getting hunted by Ringwraiths, dark-cloaked, half living, half dead people riding dark horses who are servants of Mordor. \u201c\u2019I wonder if it\u2019s Gandalf coming for us\u2019 said Frodo; but even as he said this he had a feeling that it was not so, a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him\u201d(p.97). At this point Frodo realizes that there\u2019s more to this quest than Gandalf, the great wizard who sent him on the quest, lets on.\tThe theme of the story is adventure because Frodo and his gang of hobbits are always on the run from the Ringwraiths while getting assisted by Gandalf\u2019s friends along the way. One night, Frodo and his gang checked into an inn where a man named Strider came up to them and told them that the Ringraiths know they were there. Strider let the hobbits sleep in this room and set up dummies in the hobbits room. In the morning they came back into the hobbit\u2019s room and saw that the dummies had been torn apart by the Ringraiths. The author\u2019s style of righting in narrative with lots of details and occasional poems/songs. The way he tells the story is very interesting because it makes you think that something exciting will happen any moment. I like the way he described the characters and scenery. I could picture them clearly in my mind. Even though the story was slow to begin it really picked up by the middle. Even though the book was really long I hope I can read more in the series. \n         ", "book": "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)", "user": "Adam Williams", "stars": "5", "date": "Aug 25, 14", "likes": "0"},

Bilbo, Frodo's adopted father, mysteriously disappears and leaves Frodo with a magic ring. A symbol in this book would be the ruling ring. The ring would be a symbol because the ring represents the evil that is inside everyone. I know the ring is a symbol of evil because when Frodo tells people about the ring they become angry and even violent. Boromir, a member of the fellowship, tries to take the ring from Frodo and use it against Sauron. He becomes angry and attacks Frodo because the ring is telling him to take it from Frodo. This book reminds me of The Fellowship of the Ring movie because it is based on the book. While the movie is based off the book, it does not follow the book very well. The movie leaves out the scene where the hobbits meet Tom Bombadil. It also leaves out the part where the tree almost kills Merry and Pippin. I enjoyed this book because it has many twists and turns. I also like this book because it is very descriptive which makes the characters come to life. I was surprised when a character fought the Brolog and got swallowed up by the pit that opened up. This was surprising because the author makes it sound like the Brolog was defeated, but then it takes one of the characters with him into the pit.
